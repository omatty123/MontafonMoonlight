<p>The train was passing through Pisa station. It was still an hour and a half to Florence. Florence was the city of fortune where Mr. Willi had met his musical mentor, Olivier Messiaen, at the Teatro Comunale. For Author Jeong, however, Florence called to mind two things before anything else: Dante, author of the <em>Divine Comedy</em>, and the Medici family, patrons of the Renaissance masters. The name Medici derived from <em>medico</em>, meaning "physician." Having first amassed their fortune in the pharmaceutical trade and then built great wealth through banking, the Medicis were a distinguished house that produced three popes and numerous rulers of Florence from the fourteenth to the seventeenth century. Lorenzo de' Medici, the godfather of Renaissance art, was without question the most extraordinary figure among them.</p>

<p>Until the first half of the thirteenth century, Florence had been a very small city compared to Milan or Rome. It was the economic prosperity of its merchants that launched the city's spectacular rise. After the Crusades, Florentine merchants of the fourteenth century imported wool from England and Belgium and exported fine woolen cloth. As a result, Florence grew wealthy, and its banking branches spread across all of Europe. Trade flourished to such a degree that the Florentine florin became a common currency throughout Europe, much like the euro today, and a banking system of free remittances and bills of exchange was firmly established. Florentine banking reached full bloom under Cosimo de' Medici in the fifteenth century. Political turmoil came to an end as well. Cosimo instructed the people of Florence to collect and create everything they could. This was the very spark that ignited Renaissance art. As Cosimo himself once said:</p>

<p>"I know well the temperament of Florence. If the day comes when we Medicis are driven out, it will not take even fifty years. But objects endure."</p>

<p>What Cosimo left behind was not merely buildings, paintings, sculptures, and ancient manuscripts. He gave his own villa to the humanist Ficino so that he could study the Greek and Roman classics, funded the reconstruction of the Basilica of San Lorenzo, and became the foremost patron of Renaissance artists. It was also Cosimo who founded the Academia Platonica, making Florence the center of classical scholarship. Under Medici patronage, the University of Florence published the first printed edition of Homer.</p>

<p>In this way, Cosimo, as ruler of the republic, laid the foundations of Renaissance art. His grandson Lorenzo restored the monarchical system and wielded his political acumen to make the economy flourish further still; with that power, Renaissance art entered its golden age. Lorenzo is especially renowned for discovering and sponsoring the universal genius Leonardo da Vinci and the great Michelangelo. While Cosimo had founded the University of Pisa and cultivated leading scholars, Lorenzo's passion lay in the education of young talent. He built a school beside the Medici Palace, lent it his collection of ancient busts and paintings, and commissioned students to carve statues in the school garden. It was there that he happened upon a boy sculpting the head of an old faun. The boy was Michelangelo. Impressed by his skill, Lorenzo adopted him into the Medici household and allowed him to devote himself entirely to sculpture and painting. Leonardo da Vinci, born in the town of Vinci, likewise received Lorenzo's patronage. Working with remarkable skill at Verrocchio's workshop in Florence, the twelve-year-old Leonardo caught Lorenzo's eye. When Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan, sought a sculptor for an equestrian statue honoring his father, Lorenzo recommended Da Vinci, giving the young artist the opportunity that would introduce his genius to the world.</p>

<p>The moment they stepped off at Florence station, a few raindrops began to fall. They stopped at the Mercato near the station. Leather goods shops lined both sides of the alley. Since the rain threatened to grow heavier, they had no choice but to buy an umbrella. When they opened it, a photograph of a cathedral was printed across the canopy. Florence has twelve churches, and several among them had been built with Medici patronage. Nearly every landmark and treasure in Florence, it was clear, was connected to the Medicis in one way or another.</p>

<p>Umbrella in hand, the first place they visited was the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore, Florence's most iconic landmark. Also known as the Florence Duomo, the complex comprises the Baptistery of San Giovanni and the bell tower, a work of Giotto. Arnolfo di Cambio (1245-1302) drew up the original plans in the late thirteenth century, and the cathedral was completed when Filippo Brunelleschi (1377-1446) raised the immense octagonal dome, making it the largest church in the world at the time. Giotto di Bondone (1267-1337) devoted his life to building the bell tower, and Andrea Pisano (1270-1348) labored on its completion until the Black Death took him. The sheer devotion of these men left Author Jeong and his wife awestruck.</p>

<p>The cathedral's facade was a true Gothic spectacle, its pointed spires thrusting skyward as if carrying the prayers of the faithful up to heaven. The geometric inlays of black marble set into white seemed certain to move any pilgrim to wonder. Giotto's bell tower, compared to the Leaning Tower of Pisa, was less ornate and more restrained. If Korea's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dabotap" target="_blank">Dabotap</a> was Pisa's tower in its elaborate beauty, then Giotto's bell tower was like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seokgatap" target="_blank">Seokgatap</a> in its quiet dignity. Since even with tickets one would have to wait an hour or two, Author Jeong and his wife turned instead toward the Basilica of Santa Croce, where a statue of Dante stands before the entrance.</p>

<p>Santa Croce's nickname is "the church of genius tombs." It houses the sarcophagi of Dante, Michelangelo, Galileo, and Machiavelli, among others. But the Jeong couple's purpose in going there was solely to see Dante's statue; they had no other aim. As if on cue, the rain stopped and the sky was clearing to blue. What had Dante looked like in life? They were burning with curiosity. On the way, they paused at the Piazza della Signoria in front of the town hall, where they spent a long while admiring and photographing Michelangelo's masterpiece, the <em>David</em> (a replica). The model for the <em>David</em> was said to be Giuliano de' Medici, famed for his beauty and dead before his time. Art historians describe the figure as the young David, around twenty years old, facing Goliath. Whatever the case, the tense expression on the young man's face, the veins visible on the back of his hand, the innocent rendering of the male anatomy: the realism of it all inspired a sense of awe.</p>

<p>After a lunch of spaghetti, Author Jeong and his wife at last stood before Dante's statue. Four lions seemed to stand guard for him on the pedestal. A single eagle perched beside the hem of Dante's cloak, its sharp beak thrust upward. Dante's expression, with his aquiline nose, was unexpectedly cold. There was something critical and rational about it. It seemed to reveal the Florentine temperament. The people of Florence were known for their fierce independence and sharp critical spirit. And yet it was precisely this temperament that had driven the advancement of learning and art.</p>

<p>Before long, they unfolded a map and set out in search of Dante's House, his birthplace. After winding through several alleys, they found it. Visitors were surprisingly few. The unadorned brick building had the look of a fallen noble's home. Dante lost his mother at eight and his father, who had worked in lending and money-changing, at sixteen, leaving the boy to take on the role of head of household. Precocious as he was, Dante fell in love at first sight with Beatrice when he was just ten years old. Nine years later, he encountered Beatrice again by chance near the Ponte Vecchio, but by then both were married. From that day, Dante wrote love poems for Beatrice until her sudden, untimely death, and he published them as <em>Vita Nuova</em> (1295). Five years later, Dante joined the Guild of Physicians and Apothecaries of Florence and distinguished himself with his eloquence. He became one of the three highest-ranking officials in the Florentine government. But it was from this point that Dante became entangled in political strife. While away in Rome, he was charged with bribery and various offenses, tried in absentia, and found guilty. He abandoned all hope of returning home and wandered in exile until the day he died. The <em>Divine Comedy</em>, Dante's greatest masterpiece, was written during this period. Composed of three canticles, <em>Inferno</em>, <em>Purgatorio</em>, and <em>Paradiso</em>, the work was all the more celebrated for being written not in Latin but in the Tuscan vernacular. The literary critic Harold Bloom once said of Dante's life: "The life of Dante Alighieri is like a rough, turbulent poem. 'Paradise' is beyond his reach, and he is closer to 'Hell' than to 'Purgatory.'" That assessment seemed exactly right.</p>

<p>Climbing to the fifth floor of Dante's House, they noticed Dante's bed and a bronze statue of him. The bronze had been donated on June 16, 2016, by the Russian sculptor Stepan Mokrush to commemorate Dante's 750th anniversary. Then I was stopped short by three posters explaining the <em>Divine Comedy</em>. The original title was <em>La Comedia</em>! A passage from the <em>Inferno</em> that I had never understood in my school days suddenly made sense just from seeing the original title. In the fourth canto of the <em>Inferno</em>, Homer, Aristotle, Socrates, and others are consigned to Hell simply because they were born before Christ and never received baptism. The very idea of it was a <em>comedia</em>. From the fifth floor, Giotto's bell tower was visible. Dante's House had been right there the whole time; they had wandered for nothing.</p>

<p>At length, Author Jeong and his wife wished to savor the Renaissance treasures left behind by the Medici family at their leisure. The republican government building commissioned by Cosimo had become the Uffizi Gallery, and they longed to encounter the spirit of the Medicis, who had aspired to make their city a great power of culture. At the very least, the Uffizi did not display the plundered artifacts of weaker nations, as did the imperialist British Museum or the Louvre. They would also cross the Ponte Vecchio to visit the Pitti Palace. After all, it was said to house the works of Michelangelo, Da Vinci, and other geniuses of the age.</p>

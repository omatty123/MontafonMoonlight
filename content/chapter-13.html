<p>Author Jeong and his wife went to the Thai restaurant again. On their first day in Montafon, Mr. Willi had paid for dinner; this time, Chairwoman Kwon offered to treat them. The Jeongs felt a little guilty but decided to accept her kindness. It was still early, and several tables were empty. Willi and the group sat by the window overlooking the Montafon mountains.</p>

<p>A tall, cheerful waitress came over with menus. Willi pointed at the menu and asked her to explain. The waitress recommended two dishes and described them. Jeong was planning to order the same pork-leg rice bowl he had eaten before. The rice wasn’t as sticky as Korean rice, but the lean pork, free of fat, had been wonderfully chewy. The waitress smiled brightly and explained kindly as she held up the menu.</p>

<p>“There are two rice dishes,” she said. “One is Khao Kha Mu, stewed pork leg over rice, and the other is Khao Pad, fried rice with shrimp, squid, chicken, pork, and egg. We also have noodle dishes: Mama Pad Kee Mao Kung, spicy fried instant noodles with shrimp and squid; and Pad Thai, stir-fried rice noodles with shrimp, chicken, tofu, and crushed peanuts. For salad, I recommend Yam Woon Sen, a spicy, tangy glass-noodle salad with shrimp, squid, and lettuce.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Park, saying she didn’t care much for pork, ordered Pad Thai. Author Jeong again chose the Khao Kha Mu. Willi and Chairwoman Kwon ordered a Yam Woon Sen salad to share, along with Pad Thai and Mama Pad Kee Mao Kung, respectively.</p>

<p>While waiting for the food, they refreshed themselves with the Thai drink, coconut water, placed on the table. Chairwoman Kwon spoke first, her tone tinged with regret.</p>

<p>“It’s been only three days since we came to Montafon, but it feels much longer. Tomorrow morning we’ll have to say goodbye to Mr. Willi. That’s why I’d like to pay for tonight’s dinner. You’ll miss him too, won’t you, Mr. and Mrs. Jeong?”</p>

<p>“I’d like to thank Mr. Willi for his warm hospitality,” Author Jeong said. “And of course, Chairwoman Kwon as well. Dr. Werner isn’t here with us tonight, but I’m grateful for all his efforts too.”</p>

<p>“Werner went to Bregenz to see some friends,” Willi said. “He’ll be back early tomorrow. It’s been a long time since he’s met them.”</p>

<p>Mr. Willi added, “Meeting you, Author Jeong and Mrs. Jeong from Korea, has been a blessing. I truly thank you for understanding my music. I hope we can meet again and talk more.”</p>

<p>Chairwoman Kwon seconded Mr. Willi’s wish. “Since Author Jeong and his wife have come to Montafon once, they’ll surely come twice, or three times, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“We hope so too,” Author Jeong said.</p>

<p>“You will, absolutely. If not, I’ll come to Korea and bring you myself.”</p>

<p>At that, Mr. Willi rolled his eyes playfully and laughed. “Sonja, don’t kidnap them! Ha-ha-ha.”</p>

<p>“Our time together has gone so quickly. Mr. Willi says he has a question for you, Author Jeong.”</p>

<p>“Please, go ahead,” Jeong said.</p>

<p>“Yes, absolute silence, absolute stillness. How do you say that in Buddhism?”</p>

<p>“It is called <em>jeongmyeol</em>. It is a state of utter emptiness where everything has perfectly vanished. Upon entering that state, the ego, the self, disappears, and I exist as the whole. I told you that practitioners undergo ascetic practices to reach that state.”</p>

<p>“<em>Jeongmyeol</em>, so practitioners undergo austerities to realise that. Ah, I resonate with the notion of existing as the whole. In my own case, I came to understand that <em>jeongmyeol</em> doesn’t only exist within nature somewhere, but also within my own mind. In that moment, nature and I, the universe and I, become the whole.”</p>

<p>“I understand one hundred per cent what you mean about becoming the whole musically, Mr. Willi. There are people who live within the clamour of the city yet whose minds dwell as if in tranquil mountains, and there are those who live amidst tranquil mountains yet whose minds dwell as if in the clamour of the city. You seem like a composer who carries the tranquil mountains within you.”</p>

<p>“Of course, it was only after leaving the hospital and after much time had passed that I realised stillness existed within my heart. It was when my life had matured. Until then, I’d wandered the Montafon mountains for years. With no work came no income. Composing was beyond my reach. For years, I carried a small recorder. I recorded the sounds of mountain animals, water, even the crack of a branch breaking. When I listened to those recordings some 45 years later, the sound quality wasn’t great, but it gave me an idea for how to recreate that very same sound. Birds communicate with each other using very high-pitched notes from great heights, while we humans communicate with each other using much lower frequencies, don’t we? So, by making the bird sounds lower and the water sounds higher, it seemed like we could create sounds we could communicate with. The <em>Nacht­schwalbe</em> (nightjar) produces sound at an incredible speed in just a few seconds. But when I slowed down that sound, I could understand what it meant.”</p>

<p>"I never intended to use such things in my compositions, but the composer Olivier Messiaen, whom I most respect and who taught me so much, would orchestrate bird songs directly and have them performed immediately."</p>

<p>"Then what significance did bird songs hold for you?"</p>

<p>"My interest lay entirely in how these sounds within nature operate within harmony, that was my true concern."</p>

<p>“So rather than directly translating natural sounds into music as a composer, you were more interested in nature’s order or underlying principles?”</p>

<p>“That was precisely the reason I studied the bird songs I had recorded. If I, too, could perhaps be a bird, how should I go about reproducing its song? I needed to discover that secret to communicate with them, didn't I? I tried slowing down the recordings and then playing them on my clarinet. But I could never perfectly reproduce the birdsong, because certain notes would simply stop and not return. When I sped the recording up fourfold, the clarinet produced sounds it couldn't make before, but it was still not perfect. In the end, I discovered within my own heart the exact equivalent of nature's absolute silence. There is much music in this world that has no connection to nature. But the music that holds the most meaning for me is that which is born from a profound relationship with nature. When you turn inward, the sound you hear in the deepest part of your heart, from within that absolute silence, that is what is truly precious.”</p>

<p>"In seeking nature’s absolute silence, that absolute stillness, you found absolute silence within your own heart."</p>

<p>"Decades ago, when I wandered around collecting the sounds of nature, I was searching outwardly. Now, however, the silence within my heart has become precious, because all the sounds of nature already reside within the mind’s absolute stillness. I realized that the birdsong heard in nature and the birdsong heard within the mind’s absolute silence are one and the same. Everything exists within the mind. Thus, only the absolute stillness, the absolute silence within the heart, is truly precious."</p>

<p>"Hearing Mr. Willi speak of perceiving absolute silence within his mind reminded me of an old poem. It's about a Chinese Buddhist nun who once left her hermitage in search of spring. They say she crossed hills, climbed mountains, and even trod upon the clouds in her quest, yet she never saw spring. In the end, having failed to find it, she returned to her hermitage only to discover spring had arrived right there in the plum blossoms blooming in her courtyard. This also brings to mind the teaching, “All phenomena are created by the mind” (一切唯心造), that the mind is like a painter, sketching out all of reality. Put another way, everything exists within the mind."</p>

<p>Mr. Willi was truly touched by Author Jeong's words and exclaimed with delight that it was a profoundly moving poem. Just then, their dinner was served, preventing the conversation from continuing, but the poem was beautiful enough to soothe the regret of this being their final meal together. For Author Jeong, the braised pork rice bowl they had for dinner was even more delicious than he remembered from his first try. Unlike the excessively salty spaghetti alle vongole he had for lunch, this dish was perfectly suited to the Korean palate. The prawns in the Yam Woon Sen salad were also exquisite.</p>

<p>After the meal.</p>

<p>They moved to the village theater to watch a traditional Montafon play. As they didn't understand German, Author Jeong and his wife were not particularly moved by it. Frida, the woman said to be meeting Mr. Willi freely, slipped in quietly, but they paid her no mind, as matters between men and women often have their inscrutable aspects. For Author Jeong, however, the traditional Montafon costumes felt endearingly familiar, as they resembled those from Switzerland. The men wore round, cake-like hats, shorts, and long socks pulled up to their knees, while the women wore checkered blouses and skirts that flared out at the bottom like morning glory flowers. Among the cast, one man in particular gave Author Jeong a start. There was a male performer who bore an uncanny resemblance to the late children's author Jeong Chaebong, who had been both his university senior and his workplace colleague. It was a profoundly emotional moment for Author Jeong, as if he had been reunited with the departed writer.</p>

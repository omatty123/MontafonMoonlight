<p>The moonlight kept Author Jeong from falling asleep easily. Although he felt he would soon drift off once he lay down, the moonlight filtering through the skylight kept flickering before his eyes. He pulled the duvet over his head, but it was no use. Tossing and turning with his eyes closed, sleep seemed to drift farther and farther away. Soon after, a whispering sound kept drifting in from somewhere. Thinking it might be an auditory hallucination, Author Jeong shook his head. But it was neither a hallucination nor the sound of crickets. The whispering was coming from outside the window.</p>
<p>With no other choice, Author Jeong got up and quietly walked into the living room. After sitting briefly on the sofa, he opened the balcony window and stepped outside. The night air swept over him with a sharp chill, but he stood at the balcony railing in his slippers. The moon was high in the middle of the sky. The sky was a cloudless expanse, dark blue like a deep sea. It wasn&rsquo;t the moon that had called him out. Jeong was no sleepwalker. The sound was clearly coming from the direction of the Danube. Flowing between the reeds, the Danube shimmered gold.</p>
<p>"Sweetheart, what's wrong?"</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you were asleep, so I came out quietly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>"Actually, I woke when you were tossing and turning."</p>
<p>"I came out because I thought I heard whispering from somewhere."</p>
<p>"You'll catch a chill in this cold night air. Hurry inside."</p>
<p>Sleep had already fled far away, and Author Jeong was completely absorbed by the identity of the whispering sound.</p>
<p>"It sounds just like this."</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could it be the sound of fallen leaves rustling in the river breeze?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The river breeze blew during the day, but it&rsquo;s calm now. Look at the leaves. Not a single one is moving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Park listened closely and looked around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to be coming from the Danube, the place where Mr. Willi spoke of absolute silence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>"That seems so."</p>
<p>"It might be the sound of birds nesting in the reed beds."</p>
<p>Mrs. Park spoke as if she had gotten a hint from Author Jeong&rsquo;s mention of the reed beds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds like the river water brushing against the reeds. It&rsquo;s the same sound, right? Listening to it, the night air feels cold, but my heart feels warm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The moonlight reflected on the river does look warm. It suddenly feels like a warm night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet the cold night air made Mrs. Park shrink back, and Author Jeong felt the same. The Danube, shimmering gold, was serene and beautiful, but they did not have the resolve to keep standing there taking it in. The couple returned to their room and lay down. The sound of the river brushing the reeds seemed to follow them inside and linger briefly in the room. Before long, Mrs. Park fell asleep easily, while Author Jeong, having not finished his lecture manuscript, went back out to the living room and sat on the sofa. Now the river&rsquo;s low whisper was warm yet distinct.</p>
<p>Author Jeong decided to conclude his lecture with the question, &ldquo;Why do I study Buddhist literature?&rdquo; because he had omitted a self-introduction in both the opening and main body. For the audience, a speaker&rsquo;s self-introduction could be a matter of courtesy. Jeong judged that explaining the history of Korean Buddhist literature first would be the right way to express his identity as a Korean.</p>
<p>&lt;Korean Buddhist literature begins in the Unified Silla period, one of Korea&rsquo;s ancient states. From the mid-7th century to the early 10th century, poetry using Buddhist themes flourished. Buddhist literature then continued vigorously through the Goryeo period, from the early 10th century to the late 14th century. It was therefore central to Korean literature from the mid-7th century to the late 14th century. During the five hundred years of the Joseon period, Buddhist literature grew alongside Confucian literature as paired traditions. It was only in the modern era, with the influx of Western literature, that Buddhist literature shifted from the center to the margins of Korean art.</p>
<p>However, I am certain that Buddhist literature and Buddhist art will not disappear from Korean society, because Buddhism is part of Korea&rsquo;s traditional culture and traditional thought. As Korea entered modernity and Buddhist literature was pushed away from the center of Korean literary life, a new phenomenon emerged in which foreign Buddhist literature was introduced to Korea. The poetry of the great Indian writer Gandhi, still loved by Koreans today, and Hermann Hesse&rsquo;s novel <em>Siddhartha</em> are among those examples.</p>
<p>Being deeply immersed in Buddhism, I read many biographies and novels about the Buddha. Hesse&rsquo;s <em>Siddhartha</em> moved me deeply. It is a novel that depicts only half of the Buddha&rsquo;s life, covering the period up until Prince Siddhartha of Kapilavastu leaves home and attains enlightenment as the Buddha. It portrays the human Siddhartha&rsquo;s anguish and love. I believe that is why it was so moving, because young Siddhartha is a human being who struggles just as we do. In my university years, I learned from Hesse that no matter how outstanding a sage may be, a writer must portray the human in order to truly gain the reader&rsquo;s sympathy.</p>
<p>I once heard my mentor Hong Gi-sam, who studied German literature at Heidelberg University, call Schopenhauer the &lsquo;father of German Buddhist literature.&rsquo; I also learned that two figures influenced by Schopenhauer were Nietzsche and Wagner. Wagner&rsquo;s opera libretto <em>The Victors </em>(Die Sieger) is a Buddhist opera. Its title was inspired by the Buddhist text the <em>Dhammapada</em>.</p>
<p><em>&lsquo;Those who conquer themselves are the greatest victors of all. Conquering oneself is harder than vanquishing thousands on the battlefield.&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>The story of Wagner&rsquo;s <em>Die Sieger</em> is also based on Buddhist scripture. The heroine, Pragriti, the daughter of an outcaste, falls into erotic love after being captivated by the appearance of Ananda, a disciple of the Buddha. Eventually she hears the Buddha teach that in a past life, when she was the daughter of a Brahmin, she mocked and rejected the chieftain&rsquo;s son when he confessed his love, and that as a karmic consequence she has been born in this life as the daughter of a low-caste chieftain to suffer the pain of love. Realizing her situation, she becomes Ananda&rsquo;s spiritual sister, loving him only in spirit. This scriptural story naturally frames the opera&rsquo;s theme as an agape-like love rooted in self-overcoming.</p>
<p>Wagner is said to have written in a letter to his wife Mathilde Wesendonck that &ldquo;the greatest and most important phenomenon the world can offer is not the &lsquo;world conqueror&rsquo; (Welteroberer), but the one who overcomes the external world through overcoming the self (Wetuberwinder).&rdquo; This suggests how deeply Wagner was drawn into Buddhist teachings, which emphasize human reason and will.</p>
<p>To date, I have written many novels centered on Korea&rsquo;s great Buddhist masters. This has been part of my effort to explore the virtues and identity that Koreans must never forget. These include Mountains Are Mountains, Water Is Water, the life story of Master Seongcheol, who practiced without sparing his life for truth, and&nbsp;<em>Musoyu - the Novel</em>, a biography of Master Beopjeong, who tirelessly sought dialogue with Christian leaders for the recovery of humaneness.</p>
<p>Under the title <em>Seven Years of Yi Sun-sin, </em>I am currently serialising the story of Yi Sun-sin , whom Koreans most revere as the admiral who fought the Japanese navy, winning 23 battles out of 23, and whom one Japanese general revered as a military god . As for future plans, I wish to write a novel exploring the life and love of Mrs. Francesca, who lived as a boundary-dweller between Austria and Korea. I hope that this novel might then be adapted into an opera to be performed in Vienna, Austria.&gt;</p>
<p>Having finished his lecture at the crack of dawn, Author Jeong closed his eyes contentedly. Though the moon would soon set and dawn would break, he felt he would sleep sweetly and deeply, however fitfully. Having fully prepared his lecture in advance, the mental burden had lifted. Listening to the river's affectionate murmurings like a lullaby, Author Jeong drifted into a deep slumber.</p>
<p>&lt;<em>To be continued</em>&gt;</p>

<p>The Goethe Museum was very close to the hotel where Author Jeong and his wife were staying. It took only about a 15-minute walk. The Goethe Museum was the place where Goethe had stayed during his travels in Rome. As Author Jeong headed toward the museum, a thought suddenly crossed his mind.</p>

<p>“Why did Goethe abandon his fame and comfortable life in Germany and come to Rome? What was Goethe hoping to see in Italy?”</p>

<p>At the left end of the Corso Street in front of the hotel where Author Jeong was staying lay the Roman Forum, and at the right end was Piazza del Popolo. Piazza del Popolo, meaning “People’s Square,” located between the Pincian Hill and the Tiber River, was designed in 1820 by the architect Giuseppe Valadier. At the center of the square rose a 36-meter-high obelisk, a 3rd-century BCE artifact brought from Egypt. The Porta del Popolo had been the northern gate through which people entered Rome from Europe since ancient times. It was said that foreigners had to pass through the Porta del Popolo, so Goethe must have gone through that gateway as well.</p>

<p>The Goethe Museum was not yet open. So Author Jeong and his wife had no choice but to walk over to Piazza del Popolo to pass the time. On the wall of one building in the square hung a Samsung mobile phone billboard, as if flaunting our national power. On one side of the square there was also the Leonardo da Vinci Museum. A street musician, from early morning, strummed a guitar and sang the familiar Beatles song “Yesterday.” Author Jeong and his wife wandered around the square until 10 a.m., when the Goethe Museum would open. At the southern entrance of the Corso Street stood the so-called “Twin Churches,” Santa Maria dei Miracoli and Santa Maria di Montesanto. Built in the 17th century, they were places where Martin Luther celebrated his first Mass and where Galileo was once imprisoned. Now they serve as the French Embassy. Once again, thinking of Goethe, Author Jeong sank into contemplation. He recalled a page from a world literature encyclopedia he had read back home.</p>

<p>Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was born in Frankfurt, Germany, on August 28, 1749. As a child, Goethe composed poems at the age of eight and published his first collection of poetry at thirteen, earning him the reputation of a prodigy. Though not of noble birth, he grew up in a wealthy family, naturally exposed to literature, painting, and music. His father often told the sensitive young Goethe stories of travel and the sculptures, maps, and museum specimens brought back from Italy stimulated the boy’s curiosity. Italy naturally took shape as Goethe’s ideal land.</p>

<p>At university, under his father’s insistence, Goethe studied law and then returned to his hometown to work as a lawyer. But his true interest was always literature, not law. In fact, while socializing with various writers, Goethe began to practice writing poetry and plays. In 1772, after leaving Frankfurt to work in Wetzlar, Goethe fell into an unrequited love. The woman was Charlotte Buff, the fiancée of his friend Johann Christian Kestner. After returning home, Goethe was devastated to hear that his friend Karl Wilhelm Jerusalem, who had been in a situation similar to his own, had committed suicide.</p>

<p>Based on this tragic news about his friend and his own experiences, Goethe wrote the novel &lt;The Sorrows of Young Werther&gt; in 1774. In his mid-twenties, Goethe became Germany’s leading writer overnight with a single work. The bestseller &lt;The Sorrows of Young Werther&gt; shook Europe. The yellow waistcoat and blue coat worn by the protagonist Werther even became fashionable among young people. In some countries, young men ended their lives with pistols, just like Werther.</p>

<p>Perhaps burdened by the praise pouring in, Goethe left Frankfurt in 1775 and headed to Weimar, which became his second hometown. Karl August, the new ruler of the small duchy with a population of 6,000, trusted Goethe as an avid reader and entrusted him with state affairs. Goethe was appointed a privy councillor and given the rights to operate silver and copper mines. Yet Goethe dreamed not of comfort but of escape. This was due to the thirst for art that surged within him. Beyond comfort always loomed the shadow of anxiety and dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>Goethe called this condition of mind and body a severe illness. He often complained, “I have wings, but I cannot use them.” Neither his relationship with his intellectual lover Charlotte von Stein nor his association with contemporary intellectuals such as Herder could wash away his anguish. Finally, after ten years of life in Weimar, Goethe decided to flee. The place he chose was Italy, the ideal land of his childhood. In his diary dated September 3, 1786, Goethe confessed the following:</p>

<p>“At three in the morning, I secretly slipped out of Karlsbad. Had I not done so, people would have prevented me from leaving. Those friends who sincerely wished to celebrate my birthday on August 28 had every reason to dissuade me. But I could no longer remain there. Packing only a travel bag and a badger-skin knapsack, I boarded the mail coach alone and reached Zwota at 7:30 in the morning. It was a beautiful and quiet morning filled with mist.”</p>

<p>Goethe referred to his Italian journey as a “secret journey” or an “underground journey,” because he left without telling anyone and concealed his identity. Carrying out this secret journey, Goethe toured Italy’s major landmarks, left Venice, and finally arrived in Rome. That day—the day he arrived at the very Goethe Museum that Author Jeong and his wife were now entering—was November 1, 1786. Goethe recorded the emotion of that day in his diary:</p>

<p>“(Omitted) For the past several years, I have felt as though I were ill. The only way to cure it was to come here, to see it with my own eyes, and to place my body upon this land. (Omitted)”</p>

<p>Wouldn’t anyone sympathize with Goethe’s words? For Goethe, travel was a process of healing himself. At the counter on the museum’s second floor, they received their admission tickets; visitors aged 65 and over were given a discount. It was only a few euros, but still a stroke of luck.</p>

<p>The museum was not large. It was small enough to see all the rooms in about 20 minutes. There was a room displaying Goethe’s books, a room with his portraits, and rooms exhibiting his botanical sketches and notebooks in which he meticulously recorded travel expenses. Yet Author Jeong found himself unable to leave for quite some time while gazing at Goethe’s portrait titled &lt;Goethe in the Campagna&gt;, painted by Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein. It was as if he had been seized by Goethe, suddenly come alive from within the painting. Though it was a copy of the portrait housed at the Städel Museum in Germany, to Author Jeong’s eyes it was impossible to distinguish the original from the reproduction. It was the portrait Goethe himself had liked best among all those made of him. Draped in a white cloak, Goethe gazes at the ruins scattered across the Campagna plain south of Rome. On Goethe’s face rested the happiness bestowed by his Italian journey. In a letter dated August 11, 1787, sent from Rome, Goethe wrote:</p>

<p>“There is not a single day that passes without acquiring or training my knowledge of art. Just as water easily fills a bottle cap dipped into it, a person rich in sensitivity and prepared in spirit can savor inner fulfillment in Rome.”</p>

<p>After leaving the Goethe Museum, Author Jeong and his wife decided to go to the Campagna plain, the background of Goethe’s portrait, and called a taxi. The driver explained that the Campagna had aqueducts, bridge-like water channels. Come to think of it, Author Jeong recalled seeing aqueduct ruins somewhere near the middle right edge of Goethe’s portrait. He remembered learning in history class that bridge-type aqueducts, which used the gradient of terrain to convey water, had been developed since ancient Roman times. Without advanced civil engineering and architecture, and without humanity’s tenacious challenge, such structures would have been impossible. Goethe, too, must have been deeply impressed by the aqueducts built to supply water from distant sources to Roman citizens’ fountains, public baths, and the villas of nobles and the wealthy. The representative Aqueduct of Claudius was begun in 38 CE by Emperor Caligula and completed only in 52 CE by Claudius, the fourth emperor of the Roman Empire. Through it and ten other channels, about 300 million gallons of clean water were supplied daily to the city of Rome. The aqueduct ruins before Author Jeong and his wife stretched an astonishing 90 kilometers from the source. Author Jeong recalled a line from &lt;Faust&gt;, which Goethe conceived and began writing at the age of 23 and completed more than 60 years later, just months before his death: “Awe is the finest emotion that humanity possesses.”</p>

<p>Author Jeong wondered whether it had been misfortune that Mr. Willi had not met Goethe in Rome. Had he met Goethe, he might have gained no small amount of inspiration as a composer.</p>

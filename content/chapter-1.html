  <p><em>Morning, July 28, 2025</em></p>

  <p>Author Jeong, his temples streaked with gray, stepped out of the taxi with his wife, Mrs. Pak, immediately upon reaching the third floor of Incheon International Airport's Terminal 2. Shortly afterward, they went to Counter D to check their luggage and then completed the departure process together. At last, with some time to spare, they had a simple breakfast and waited to board their flight to Vienna. The perfectly air-conditioned international departure lounge stood cool against the 35°C scorching heat outside. Passengers sat in groups of two or three, waiting impassively for boarding time. Beyond the gate, the Vienna-bound aircraft had already pulled up and stood waiting. On the arrow-straight runway stretching like an expressway, aircraft continuously landed and took off in succession. In the soundproofed lounge, not a single noise from the aircraft reached them. Thus the worlds inside and outside the glass seemed utterly divorced from each other. Beyond the runway, the sky appeared deliberately calm, removed from the bustling scenery below.</p>

  <p>Cumulus clouds like eternal snow drifted like mountain peaks across the sky—even these appeared surreal. Earth and sky seemed strangely segregated, as if the infinite, endless sky had stealthily descended from some alien realm. Normally, clouds of various shapes might stir personal emotions, but the cumulus clouds seen through the airport glass seemed indifferent—present or not, it didn’t matter—as if they had casually drifted down from another sky.</p>

  <p>Before long, an announcement for passengers on the Vienna flight came over the speakers. In stark contrast to the apathetic scenery beyond the windows came this profoundly mundane sound: boarding would soon begin at Gate 13. Even before the announcement, passengers had already begun milling around the gate. The Western crowd included backpack-toting middle-aged couples, though the majority appeared to be college students or youths in summer attire—clearly on academic break. Author Jeong, seated beside his wife, hoisted his backpack. His wife—perhaps from nerves—made one final restroom visit. Jeong too felt bladder pressure but resisted, as the need wasn't pressing.</p>

  <p>This was Jeong’s third trip to Vienna, and each time his wife, a ceramic artist, accompanied him with a clear purpose. Mrs. Pak served concurrently as his meticulous manager. She logged local geography and weather information in her notebooks, recorded and later transcribed his interviews—among other support tasks. She always carried a full pharmacopoeia of emergency medicines—cold remedies, digestive aids, antidiarrheals, and calming herbal pills—and monitored his health like a nurse, keeping him in top condition. An avid traveler herself, Mrs. Pak considered this no burden; indeed, she secretly anticipated Author Jeong’s next research destination.</p>

  <p>After presenting his ticket to an airport attendant, Jeong waited for Mrs. Park in the jetway to the Vienna-bound flight. This transitional jetway, merely a temporary connector, nevertheless evoked peculiar sensations. Was this a bridge through clouds? A celestial thoroughfare? Yet simultaneously it foreshadowed their imminent temporal and spatial severance from Incheon Airport. At the aircraft door, two stewardesses rechecked tickets before guiding passengers down the aisle. Jeong yielded to Mrs. Pak's superior spatial awareness, letting her lead. With one practiced sweep, she located their seats, window-side, as always preferred.</p>

  <p>“Window seats with wing views.”</p>

  <p>Mrs. Pak's face blossomed into a smile—though premature for celebration. Should a woman occupy Jeong’s adjacent seat, he'd need to claim the window. Like magnetic poles repelling, Mrs. Pak opposed her husband sitting beside strange women. Jeong also found it uncomfortable to sit beside a female stranger for twelve hours while his wife was on the other side. Fortunately, his seatmate proved male, rendering reseating unnecessary.</p>

  <p>Securing his seatbelt, Jeong drew a measured breath. During taxiing, a stewardess demonstrated seatbelt fastening and oxygen mask deployment per the safety briefing. Once on the runway, the plane began to pick up speed, ready for takeoff.</p>

  <p>“Sweetheart, it’s been seven years.”</p>
  <p>“Indeed. Our first trip to Austria was in 2015 and the second was in 2018.”</p>

  <p>Mrs. Pak's year-counting made the intervening years feel suddenly tangible. Especially after enduring the COVID-19 crisis for three years and four months, their previous trips to Austria felt like a distant past. A spark of curiosity flared: how would this journey articulate with those frozen memories? Yet only the tarmac of Vienna Airport would tell. After all, nothing worldly persists unchanged.</p>

  <p>As the plane climbed higher, Mrs. Park took a packet of cheongsim-hwan from her handbag, a pill that calms the heart. She placed half a pill in her mouth and chewed slowly. It was a traditional herbal medicine she would take during takeoff and landing when the external pressure made her ears feel clogged and she grew tense. For her, it was a kind of essential travel medicine. A moment later, perhaps feeling mentally calmer, she spoke briefly.</p>

  <p>“I can see the sea.”<br/>“It looks like we haven’t left Korea yet.”</p>

  <p>The West Sea's archipelago, islands large and small, were visible, but they too would soon vanish from view. Suddenly, Mrs. Park summoned up the memory of Jeong in 2015.<br/>“Back then, you were very hesitant about going to Austria. You seemed like you didn’t want to go.”</p>

  <p>“That was because of my serialized novel. I was worried the trip would break my writing rhythm, it felt like a burden.”</p>

  <p>What Author Jeong said was true. At that time, he was in the midst of serializing on the Jeollanam-do provincial government website a seven-volume historical epic featuring Yi Sun-sin, the admiral who, during Japan’s 16th-century invasion of Korea known as the <em>Seven Years’ War</em>, had won 23 out of 23 naval battles. After a decade of research and freshly into his 3-year provincial contract, the weight of expectation pressed heavily. In the decade before serialization began, he had visited the seas where Admiral Yi had won his victories, checking water depths to understand why the battles had been fought there, why the ironclad <em>geobukseon</em> (turtle ship) had been built, and how the main warship, the <em>panokseon</em>, was constructed to be more resistant to cannon fire than Japanese vessels. This serialized novel was therefore a major work summing up Jeong’s literary career and he was understandably tense about it.</p>

  <p>Now the plane was picking up speed, heading for an altitude of 30,000 ft. It cruised leisurely above the glacier-like white clouds, as though approaching the boundary between the troposphere and the stratosphere. The uniform cloudscape created an illusion of stationary hovering rather than forward motion, while flight attendants rested in their jumpseats.</p>

  <p>“Dear, are you sleeping?”<br/>“No, I was thinking about Chairwoman Kwon.”<br/>“I was thinking of her just now too.”</p>

  <p>Had Sonja Stenindl-Kwon, the Austrian-Korean head of IMK, not visited Jeong’s home, which they called Ibuljae, their 2015 trip to Austria would never have happened. While traveling between Korea and Austria, she had bought Jeong’s novels at the bookstore inside Incheon Airport, and that connection eventually brought her to Ibuljae. Originally one of the first Korean nurses dispatched to Germany and Austria, she had later changed careers and, in 1992, founded IMK, a classical music concert planning company, remarkable given that she had known nothing about classical music before. A devout Catholic, she was even responsible for flower arrangements at her parish. That such a person would be captivated by Jeong’s Buddhist-themed writing and travel all the way to Ibuljae was nothing short of surprising. Jeong once saw a notebook she showed him, with an entire page filled with the titles of his books, and recognized her sincerity immediately.</p>

  <p>It would be no exaggeration to say that the Jeong couple’s trip to Austria could not have happened without Chairwoman Kwon’s encouragement or invitation.</p>

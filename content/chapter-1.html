<h2>Vienna Bound Plane</h2>
<p>The cabin lights dim to a soft polar blue. Outside, the wing cuts an ellipse through cloud. 
You rehearse a sentence in German you will never say, then fold it into your pocket with the boarding stub. 
Across the aisle, a child sketches mountains that look like teeth; the mother nods to the rhythm of the engines. 
Somewhere over the Alps, the pilot banks and the moon rolls like a coin.</p>
<p>The stranger beside you asks where home is. You point at the map on the seatback screen—an arrow moving toward Vienna—
then shrug. Home, today, is a pressurized room where you can finally decide.</p>

<p>Moonlight of Montafon 26</p>

<p>Sculptor Giacometti and Composer Willi</p>

<p>Early in the morning, Author Jeong and Mrs. Park set off for Pisa. It was a two-hour journey by local train from Follonica. The seats were sparsely occupied and raindrops brushed across the windows. The train headed north toward the coast. The endless wheat fields of Tuscany kept appearing in the clouded windows. The train sped past station after station. Each time the station announcements came on, Italian struck them as beautiful. Like Chinese, its rising and falling tonal contours were unmistakable.</p>

<p>"Livorno Centrale!"</p>

<p><em>Centrale</em> means "central," so it meant Livorno Central Station. Before long, an announcement came that the train would be arriving at Pisa Station.</p>

<p>"Doesn't Pisa seem like a bigger city than you'd expect?"</p>

<p>"So many elegant old buildings, too. They say it's the second largest city in Tuscany after Florence."</p>

<p>Emerging from the station building, a statue stood in the square. It was like one they'd seen in Rome of Italy's first king, Victor Emmanuel II. The weather was still overcast and chilly, a stark contrast to the warm weather in Rome or Follonica. A short walk up the narrow street led to a cluster of cafés. These cafés had become landmarks in their own right. The one Author Jeong and Mrs. Park entered was Caffè Salza, which had opened its doors in 1898. Like Rome's Antico Caffè Greco, the walls were adorned with famous paintings. The warm cappuccino tasted even better in the chill.</p>

<p>After about twenty minutes of leisurely walking uphill, the Leaning Tower came into view. Street vendors trailed after them, carrying souvenirs and urging them to buy. Most of them were black and appeared to be refugees. One of the reasons to feel warmly toward Italians was the attitude of the shopkeepers. They didn't chase away the vendors; rather, they treated them kindly, like neighbors. It seemed like something anyone could learn from. Virtue is nothing other than the spirit of giving and sharing with neighbors in need.</p>

<p>The Leaning Tower of Pisa. In Piazza del Duomo there are the Leaning Tower, the cathedral, and the round baptistery, but the Leaning Tower was the first structure to catch tourists’ eyes. It was a bell tower selected as one of the Seven Wonders of the World. In 1173, architect Bonanno Pisano began construction, but when it reached the third floor (10 meters high), the ground subsided and work was halted. This was because the soil near the sea was soft, sandy earth, and because the tower’s underground foundation was only 3 meters deep. Construction resumed and was completed in 1350, but the 14,500-ton marble tower began to tilt by about 1 mm each year, and by 1990 it had become a bell tower leaning at a 5.5-degree angle.</p>

<p>Tourists who wanted to climb the Leaning Tower stood in line, waiting their turn to enter. Forty people were admitted every 15 minutes. When it was Author Jeong and Mrs. Park's turn, a female security guard scanned them with an electronic detector. The marble staircase was spiral. It was remarkable that despite four earthquakes since the late thirteenth century it had not collapsed. A scholar who studied the Leaning Tower once remarked:</p>

<p>"The tower leaned because of the soft ground, but the sandy soil absorbed the shock of the earthquakes, so the tower didn't collapse. Structures are most vulnerable to the vertical jolting of an earthquake."</p>

<p>Another reason the Leaning Tower became famous was probably because of Galileo Galilei, a native of Pisa. Galileo, an astronomer and physicist, had discovered a flaw in Aristotle's mechanics. Aristotle had argued that heavier objects hit the ground before lighter ones, but Galileo, through experiments from the Leaning Tower, proved that both heavy and light objects fell at the same rate, demonstrating that weight had nothing to do with the speed of fall. Later, Galileo advocated heliocentrism, leading to his trial in Rome. He was pardoned after promising to renounce his theory, but as he left the courtroom, he remarked, "And yet it moves. . . " as he could not bring himself to betray his own conscience.</p>

<p>The marble steps were worn smooth from countless feet. It occurred to Author Jeong that if there's anything that becomes more beautiful the more it's stepped on, it's a staircase. Finally, upon reaching the eighth and final floor, bells hung overhead. Beyond the bells, a panoramic view of Pisa's cityscape spread out before them. Author Jeong speculated that the Leaning Tower likely served not only a religious function but also as a watchtower for spotting invading enemies.</p>

<p>Author Jeong and Mrs. Park were forced to descend the bell tower, swamped by tourists. While descending, Author Jeong thought of the phrase <em>seongju goegong</em> (成住壞空), the idea that all things arise, abide for a time, decay, and return to emptiness (空 <em>kong</em>).</p>

<p>"The Leaning Tower of Pisa, too, will surely come to that in the fullness of time."</p>

<p>Restoration work that began in 1990 was completed in June 2001, and they claim the tower no longer tilts, but wouldn't it be more humble, and more accurate, to say that human effort has merely postponed the moment of its return to emptiness?</p>

<p>The doors of Pisa Cathedral, built in the shape of a Latin cross, were made of bronze. Stepping through the massive bronze doors, they saw a mosaic <em>Christ in Majesty</em> adorning the half-dome above the altar. This apse mosaic is associated with Cimabue, and the work is dated to 1302, often treated as his last. The Virgin Mary and Saint John the Apostle pray quietly on either side of Christ. To the left of the altar is a pulpit sculpted by the Renaissance master Giovanni Pisano, depicting key scenes from the Old and New Testaments, including the <em>Last Judgment.</em> Inside the elliptical dome is the <em>Assumption</em> (1627–1631), depicting the Virgin Mary seated on a cloud, escorted by angels, ascending to heaven with saints. The guidebook explains that this work was completed by the Pisan painter Orazio Riminaldi and his brother Girolamo using the encaustic technique, mixing pigments with beeswax. They likely chose this theme because the cathedral's original name was the Cathedral of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary. However, Author Jeong and Mrs. Park were unable to enter the round baptistery, which they had planned to visit last, as it was under renovation, and turned back.</p>

<p>After a spaghetti lunch at a street restaurant in Pisa, Author Jeong and Mrs. Park took the train back to Follonica Station and headed to the ancient hilltop town of Vetulonia. They wanted to see as many such towns as possible in Tuscany. Vetulonia was a fortified settlement in a region where the Etruscans, forerunners of the Romans, had built their civilization around 2500 BCE. Like the others, Vetulonia was located up a winding mountain road. Since it was Monday, the museum was closed. They had no choice but to walk up the slope to the Vetulonia citadel, which had something of the air of a museum itself. Perhaps out of regret, they recalled the Etruscan artifacts they had seen at the Vatican Museums, the Egyptian-looking figures with their large eyes, carved on marble sarcophagus lids, jars, and bowls, which had fascinated them. The souvenir shop was likewise locked. Through the shop window, among the Etruscan replicas, figures of people and animals, they could see imitations of Giacometti's slender sculptures. Author Jeong was unable to purchase a bluish bronze Giacometti reproduction and only took a photo. Alberto Giacometti (1901–1966), born in Switzerland and active in Paris, was famous as "the modern sculptor who made Picasso jealous," "Sartre's friend, the artist who embodied existentialist philosophy in sculpture," and "the artist who left behind the world's most expensive sculptures." Giacometti was a sculptor with whom Author Jeong had a small karmic connection (<em>inyeon</em>). When Jeong was working at Saemt'ŏ Publishing, he had used a photo of Giacometti's <em>Walking Man</em> on the cover of Venerable Beopjeong's <em>Standing People.</em></p>

<p>When Author Jeong asked their guide, Mr. Guster, he said that the nineteen-year-old Giacometti had been deeply inspired by Etruscan artifacts after witnessing the sudden death of a companion during a trip to Italy. A light went on in Author Jeong’s mind.</p>

<p>“Mightn’t Giacometti have been inspired by the Etruscan artifacts, especially the vivid, realistic eyes of the figures?”</p>

<p>Among Giacometti's wire-thin, elongated sculptures, aren't the eyes, where an intense gaze is felt, the most meaningful part? Giacometti himself asserted, "It is the gaze that distinguishes the living from the dead." Indeed, Giacometti reportedly began with the eyes, believing the gaze was paramount in his drawings and sculptures. Sartre, in his preface to the Giacometti exhibition catalog, explained, "It is the gaze that represents the human face, the part where human consciousness becomes visible," further solidifying Author Jeong's intuition. Author Jeong wanted to define Giacometti's sculptures as the aesthetic embodiment of emptiness. That his elongated figures were all pared thin as wire came, Author Jeong believed, from emptying and stripping away in order to approach the essence. At this point, Author Jeong felt that Giacometti, like Mr. Willi, resembled an Eastern Seon master. The soliloquy "I walk today. Tomorrow I will have no choice but to walk again" surely found its expression in <em>Walking Man, </em>enough to call to mind a wandering cloud-and-water monk (<em>unsuseong</em>, 雲水僧), forever on pilgrimage.</p>

<p>Like any other hilltop town, the church of Vetulonia stood in the center of the village. It was only after seeing the fifth- and sixth-century walls atop Vetulonia that Author Jeong finally broke free of the reverie Giacometti had evoked. The fifteenth-century <em>cappella</em> (prayer room) was impressive. Countless people, weary of hard lives, must have knelt before the statue of the Virgin Mary in prayer. Just then, a few flowers blooming along the walls were sending their fragrance into the air.</p>

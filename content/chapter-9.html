<p>The dark clouds covering the sky did not immediately release their rain. As if giving Willy time to seek shelter, the clouds gradually thinned. Consequently, the river grew dark and then bright again, its waters flowing on, steady and unchanged. The overgrown weeds on the bank, as if frightened, remained motionless before softening their appearance. The birds, which had fled far away in fear of the clouds' menace, began to appear one by one. But they did not come close to Willy.</p>

<p>Willi shuddered at the moment the river and sky, the grass on the bank, and the expressions of the birds all changed. It was the moment when the pain in his body, having reached its extreme, finally began to subside. His body felt comfortable, as if the sickness had vanished, and the river was profoundly still. A warm energy enveloped him and the river was so quiet it seemed about to speak to him.</p>

<p>Then it happened. Willi saw a single raindrop and heard the sound of it falling into the river. Because the surroundings were so still, the sound of the raindrop was whole, unmingled with any other noise. It seemed to fill the silent space with its solitary sound. He felt a comfort as if his sickness had left his body, and it was a sound he could hear only because every being in the river was silent. To Willi, it was not merely a sound, but the discovery of a clear note, the beginning of a musical journey.</p>

<p>Willi could not pull himself away from the sound of the raindrop he had just heard. It seemed as if a single raindrop contained the entire secret of the world, as if it held all the music of the world within it. Willi had completely forgotten why he had walked to this very spot. It was as if the reason, why he could no longer walk forward or turn back, why he stood rooted to the riverbank, had been stolen from him by a single drop. The sound of the raindrop had plunged him into a state of selflessness. Yet he did not feel isolated or lonely. Instead, he felt connected to everything in the river. Willi felt a profound fullness, as though in losing himself, in becoming selfless, he had instead become the whole. And though the sound of the raindrop falling vertically from the empty sky and striking the flat plane of the river seemed to spread far and sink deep, to Willi, it was something more.</p>

<p>The sound of the raindrop filled Willi's mind completely. The note that had begun at a single point grew steadily until it had occupied his entire head. Now, Willi felt as though he were trapped in a prison of raindrops, a prison that was whole, pure, and transparent as crystal.</p>

<p>"Could I bring that sound back to life?"</p>

<p>"If only that could happen someday, I’d be as happy as I am now."</p>

<p>The faint clouds had scattered, and bright daylight spread across the sky. The long-awaited midday sun finally returned, glistening on the river’s surface. The sounds of the world began to break the silence of moments before. A car raced in the distance, and a flock of birds gathered over the river. A hidden wind blew, rustling the grasses along the riverbank. Even the whistle of a train racing through the Montafon Valley could be heard. All these sounds reminded Willi that he suffered from an incurable illness. He was brought back to the reality where he could think only of death.</p>

<p>Yet Willi felt his heart fill as if he had received a gift beyond compare. A light seemed to pierce the darkness within him, born of the conviction: 'Someday, I will be as happy as I am now.' Willi did not return to the hospital. He headed for the Innsbruck train station. He was going home to Montafon.</p>

<p>"I returned home and sat down at the piano. I stayed there day and night, searching for the sound of raindrops. In a way, that's when my musical life truly began. Actually, when I was about six, I went to see a music teacher living in Montafon to learn the clarinet. He had a grand piano at the time. He was an elderly man, and if I couldn't play the clarinet as he taught me, he would punish me by pulling my ears. I disliked going to his house by the stream and told my father. After that, my father personally taught me not only the clarinet, but also the piano and violin. Though he was a carpenter, my father possessed such exceptional musical talent that he composed music. In a sense, he became my music teacher."</p>

<p>"How did you find the raindrop notes?"</p>

<p>"I found them on the piano keys after several months."</p>

<p>"You must have felt like dancing with joy then."</p>

<p>"First, I recalled the stillness of the stream at the moment the raindrops fell, and my own incurable illness. I offered a prayer of gratitude."</p>

<p>"I understand being grateful for the incurable illness that tormented you, Mr. Willi. Eastern masters subject their bodies to harsh discipline to attain enlightenment. Through this, they discover their true nature and ultimately achieve great awakening. The Buddha himself endured six years of asceticism to attain unsurpassed enlightenment. After torturing his body beyond our imagination, he achieved unsurpassed enlightenment. Of course, the Buddha knew asceticism was an extreme method, so he abandoned it before enlightenment and did not recommend it to his disciples. In Mr. Willi's case, it probably wasn't something he desired. In any case, Mr. Willi's incurable illness ultimately brings to mind the ascetic practices of East Asian Seon masters."</p>

<p>Mr. Willi just smiled. Then he gestured for them to head toward the piano in the hallway. On the desk in front of the keys, notepaper, sheet music, and pens were neatly arranged. Author Jeong sensed Mr. Willi's meticulous and tidy nature from these items. Mr. Willi sat down on the chair and immediately pressed one piano key for a long note.</p>

<p>"This single note couldn't express the sound of raindrops."</p>

<p>Writer Jung heard the 'C' note from the key Mr. Willi pressed. The low 'C' seemed to make the sound of raindrops falling into a river and sinking deep. Mr. Willi pressed another key again.</p>

<p>"Even with this single note, I still couldn't capture the sound of raindrops."</p>

<p>This time, the key Mr. Willi pressed sounded like a 'G' an octave higher. Unlike before, it seemed like the sound of raindrops spreading across a river.</p>

<p>"When I played the keys one at a time, I couldn't perfectly capture the sound of raindrops. Now, I'll play two keys simultaneously. Listen. This is the sound of raindrops I heard back then."</p>

<p>Author Jeong also understood that the sound produced by the two keys together was different from when they were played individually. It was a subtle difference, as if the sound filled the space.</p>

<p>Mr. Willi guided Author Jeong back to the living room. Author Jeong sat in the chair he had occupied earlier, and Chairman Kwon continued interpreting.</p>

<p>"As Author Jeong just heard, when I struck a single key, that note wasn't the sound of raindrops I heard by the river. I realized a single note couldn't convey it. It felt like the raindrop fell and bounced away, like it flowed away. When I struck another key together, it became a finished product, if you will. So a single note is nothing. It's incomplete. My conclusion was that two notes together must come together to be complete."</p>

<p>"So Mr. Willi's musical journey began with the enigma of a raindrop's sound. In East Asian Buddhism, practitioners call this a <em>hwadu</em>. A classic <em>hwadu</em> is the question, 'What is this?'. A <em>hwadu</em> is a question for which there is no fixed answer, because the answer to 'What is this?' is different for everyone. Furthermore, a <em>hwadu</em> is not solved through intellectual reasoning. Just as Mr. Willi sat before his piano day and night, forgetting everything in his search for the raindrop's sound, practitioners, after receiving a <em>hwadu</em> from their master, live enveloped in this doubt for a week, months, or even years. Eventually, the doubt comes to dominate their entire mind and body. The practitioners themselves become a solid mass of questioning. It is said that at this stage, this mass of doubt never disappears, whether one is active during the day, asleep at night, or even dreaming. Yet, they say the shattering of this doubt happens in a single instant. Through some stimulus, the practitioner breaks free from the mass of doubt, and in that moment, they awaken to the secret of the <em>hwadu</em>. How utterly liberating that must be! It is said that in that instant, some practitioners dance for joy, while others weep with overwhelming emotion."</p>
  
<p>"Ah, yes. When I, a seventeen-year-old who had never formally studied music at school, discovered the sound of raindrops, I think I went through a similar process. The joy was beyond words."</p>

<p>Chairman Kwon laughed and joined their conversation.</p>

<p>"Even though you two speak different languages, you understand each other's thoughts so well that I don't need to interpret."</p>

<p>In reality, Composer Willi didn't know Korean, and Author Jeong didn't know German. Yet, throughout their conversation, they understood each other's thoughts and empathized without disagreement. Mr. Willi shared more about his experience expressing the sounds of nature through instruments, following the sound of raindrops. For instance, he said that while playing the piano only allows him to express about 70% of his vision, other instruments can fill in the gaps. He mentioned that instruments like the cello, clarinet, and viola enable 100% expression, adding that it was a clear and definite experience.</p>

<p>Before they knew it, the wall clock pointed to 2 PM. This seemed to be Mr. Willi's lunchtime, as he ate only once a day. Mr. Willi got up and headed to the kitchen. Writer Jung anticipated Mr. Willi's vegetarian dish, which excluded meat. Writer Jung also avoided eating beef, a favorite among Europeans.</p>

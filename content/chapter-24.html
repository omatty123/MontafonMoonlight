<p>Author Jeong and his wife set out for an early morning walk. They chose a route that took them up Pincian Hill, past the palazzo of the Medici family, made wealthy long ago through banking, and down to the Spanish Steps. These Steps are well known as the spot where Audrey Hepburn was eating gelato and giving her memorable performance in <em>Roman Holiday</em>. The steps were already crowded with tourists. They were not there simply out of longing for Hepburn's beauty. Frankly, because it was an old film, Jeong's sense of her beauty was only faint. More than her beauty on screen, what he remembered was the testament she told her son on Christmas Eve, one year before she died. She seemed like a poet and a philosopher.</p>

<p>"If you want beautiful lips, speak kind words. If you want lovely eyes, look for the good in people. If you want a slim figure, share your food with the hungry. If you want beautiful hair, let a child run their fingers through it once a day. (Omission) As I grow older, I will come to see that I have two hands: one to help myself and one to help others."</p>

<p>The last line sounded like the Buddhist principle of <em>jari ita </em>自利利他, "self-benefit by benefitting other others," the wise language of a cleric. Her son, Sean Hepburn Ferrer, once stopped by Paengmok Port in Jindo, South Korea, to comfort the families of the Sewol ferry victims. Jeong could not help thinking, "like mother, like son." He sat down on the stairs for a moment and then stood up to visit Antico Caffè Greco located at the entrance of the street extending from the center of the square. "Antico" means "ancient Greek." A Greek owner opened Caffè Greco in 1760, and because it is recognized as the oldest café in Rome, it has been designated an Italian cultural asset. Jeong wanted to make sure to drop by.</p>

<p>The moment the doors opened at nine, Author Jeong and his wife became the first customers at Caffè Greco. The hall was not large, but every red velvet wall was densely hung with paintings, so it felt like stepping into a gallery. The café is said to own more than three hundred works and the staff were all in tailcoats. While they waited for a server, the couple looked at the paintings. Most were landscapes depicting scenes in the dim light of twilight. Many were by Impressionist painters and all were originals. A cappuccino cost nine euros, so with a one-euro tip, it came to about 13,000 won. Hardly cheap, but thinking of it as a visit to an art gallery made the expense feel less burdensome.</p>

<p>Goethe began his day here, drinking mocha at Caffè Greco. As it turns out, after Goethe, Caffè Greco became a kind of salon for German artists and notable figures. Among the familiar names were the composers Mendelssohn, Liszt, and Wagner; the philosophers Schopenhauer and Nietzsche; and the novelist Thomas Mann. Wilhelm Müller, who wrote the texts for Schubert's <em>Winterreise</em>, was also a regular. And it was not only Germans. Artists from many Western countries came as well. Denmark's fairy tale writer Andersen and the British poets Byron, Keats, and Shelley were well known visitors. It was astonishing to learn that the Russian novelist Gogol also completed the final part of <em>Dead Souls </em>here at Caffè Greco. The French poets Baudelaire and Apollinaire; the novelists Stendhal and Marcel Proust; the American writer Benjamin Franklin; the novelists Mark Twain and Nathaniel Hawthorne; and the Irish writer Oscar Wilde, among many others, were all among those who were said to have stopped in here often.</p>

<p>Author Jeong recalled his high school days, standing on the bridge near his home in Pangnim-dong, picturing the Gwangju Stream as France's Seine, and memorizing Apollinaire's <em>The Mirabeau Bridge</em>. As he drank his cappuccino, he recalled his adolescent days, when he would murmur, "Under the Mirabeau Bridge flows the Seine, and so does our love. Must I remember? That joy always comes after sorrow." It was the romanticism of adolescence, taking the trickling waters of the Gwangju Stream for Paris' Seine.</p>

<p>Their next stops were the Trevi Fountain, a ten-minute walk away, and then the Pantheon, another seven minutes beyond. The Trevi Fountain is a monumental work that carries on the Roman tradition of public fountains. In ancient Rome, fountains in the piazzas supplied citizens with drinking water, but now they exist for tourists. Designed by the architect Niccolò Salvi and completed in 1762, the Trevi Fountain is carved with two figures and horses from Greek mythology. At the center stands a prominent statue of Poseidon, the god of the sea. The water looks emerald because of the limestone on the bottom. Because it draws such crowds, unpleasant incidents sometimes occur. Police patrolled around the basin in pairs. Violations of public decorum, such as putting your feet in the water, can be fined up to 240 euros, so the couple needed to be careful.</p>

<p>From the Trevi Fountain they quickened their pace to Piazza della Rotonda, because the Pantheon stands in that square with its obelisk. "Pantheon" means "all gods." Since it is a temple dedicated to every deity, its Korean rendering would be <em>mansinjeon</em>. Hearing that Raphael, who loved the Pantheon, is buried inside, Jeong wanted to see his tomb for himself. The Pantheon is regarded as one of the greatest achievements of Roman architectural engineering, especially its magnificent rotunda and dome. Mrs. Park said:</p>

<p>“They say they’re switching to paid admission, but for now it still seems to be free.”</p>

<p>“Maybe that’s why the tourist crowds never seem to end.”</p>

<p>Tourists flowed in and out between the Corinthian granite columns at the entrance. Swept along by the crowd, they entered the rotunda, whose floor was glossy marble. Sunlight poured in through the oculus, a nine meter wide opening at the top of the dome, brightening the interior. This is the oculus that Raphael is said to have visited mostly at night to admire the moonlight passing through. The height up to the crown of the dome and the diameter of the rotunda floor are exactly 43.3 meters. This is the feature that makes architects marvel, and Jeong and his wife, too, could only be amazed by the columnless rotunda and dome. Along the lower walls of the rotunda ran the tombs of two Italian kings and of Renaissance painters and architects. Raphael's tomb was easy to spot beneath the sculptures of two birds. Jeong noted to Mrs. Park that now only a single burial space remains in the rotunda.</p>

<p>“There was once a poll asking who ought to be placed in that space, and surprisingly it turned out to be a current soccer player.”</p>

<p>“That tells you how much Italians love soccer.”</p>

<p>As Jeong hesitated over taking a taxi, he and Mrs. Park agreed to walk to the Vatican Museums. He wanted to stroll along the Tiber. The sky was overcast and a light breeze was blowing, so it was not hot. He had heard that to see the Vatican Museums properly, you would have to come in every day for a week, almost like commuting to work. So Jeong decided to look closely only at Michelangelo's <em>Creation</em> and <em>The Last Judgment</em>, and at Raphael's <em>School of Athens </em>in the Raphael Rooms, saving the rest of the artworks and sculptures for another time. Because he had reserved their tickets online, there was no need to stand in line. Had his judgment been right? Above the arched entrance, reliefs of Michelangelo and Raphael were carved. It seemed to suggest that, among the countless painters, only those two were the true protagonists of the Vatican Museums.</p>

<p>Before going on to the Raphael Rooms, he could not help looking at the sculptures in the corridor known as the Chiaramonti Gallery. Suddenly one piece caught Jeong’s eye: a goddess carved with two baby angels. Perhaps it was because his eldest daughter was pregnant with twins. There were statues of Hercules, Zeus, Athena, Roman emperors, and so on, yet at that moment why did Jeong think of Korea’s pensive Maitreya bodhisattva (Mireuk banga sayusang)? As he marveled anew at the insight of the German philosopher Karl Jaspers, recalling the praise he offered after seeing the <em>banga sayusang</em> carved by a Korean artisan at Kōryū-ji in Kyoto, Japan:</p>

<p>“I have seen the statues of the ancient Greek gods, and I have also seen superb sculptures made in the Roman era. Yet in all of them there still remained earthly, human traces that had not been fully transcended. But in the Maitreya pensive bodhisattva, the highest ideal of human existence, perfected in full, was expressed without remainder. (Omitted) I have lived for decades as a philosopher, but I have never before seen a work of art that so truthfully embodies human existence in a peaceful form.”</p>

<p>Karl Jaspers's candid confession seemed to speak for Jeong's own thoughts. With little emotional response, Jeong took in the corridor sculptures and then went on to the Raphael Rooms, to meet fifty-four Athenian luminaries including Plato, Aristotle, Apollo, Socrates, Pythagoras, and Euclid in Raphael's <em>School of Athens</em>.</p>

<p>By late February, blue, red, and white plum blossoms were blooming along the courtyard of the Jeong couple's mountain hermitage, Ibuljae. Looking at the swollen buds on the plum trees, Author Jeong reflected on the epic novel <em>The Seven Years of Yi Sunsin</em>, which he had written over the past three years. It was a work he had serialized weekly without missing a single installment. As a result, seven volumes of the epic novel, published by Jakka Publishing house, now sat on his bookshelf. Writing roughly fifty-five 200-character manuscript pages each week for a total of some 8,800 pages, the sheer scale of the work called to mind the height of Mount Everest. At times, Jeong truly felt as though he were climbing step by step toward Everest's summit. Although he received yet another offer to serialize a new work, he decided that, exhausted in both body and mind, he needed at least a month of rest. He wanted to go abroad, choose a place to stay in one or two unfamiliar places, and rest fully.</p>

<p>Mrs. Park felt the same way. Over the three years of weekly serialization, she had proofread each installment whenever Jeong finished a section. As she was teaching and running hands-on sessions for her pottery students while creating her own ceramic works, she fit proofreading into spare moments, so it was only natural that she, too, longed for rest.</p>

<p>"Sweetheart, the Trans-Siberian Railway or Machu Picchu in South America would be pretty difficult now, right?"</p>

<p>"If we were ten years younger, we could probably manage, but long-distance travel seems too taxing now."</p>

<p>"Then where shall we go? How about Greece?"</p>

<p>"But we went to Greece last November, didn't we? Even if it was only a whirlwind visit because it was a cruise."</p>

<p>"When we disembarked on Crete, I was disappointed that I alone didn't get to visit Kazantzakis's grave. I've read <em>Zorba the Greek</em> three times. You went only with the university president and one of your juniors. And beyond that, just think how many historical sites Greece has. Last year, we only saw the surface of Greece."</p>

<p>"We couldn't help it, since we had hired only one taxi."</p>

<p>Last November, several disciples had accompanied their revered teacher, Hong Gisam, former president of Dongguk University, on a trip to Greece aboard a 100,000 ton cruise ship departing from Venice. In truth as Mrs. Park observed, although they had gone to Greece, they had visited only Athens and Crete, the ports where the ship docked, and they had not seen any other historical sites. Still, for Jeong, simply paying his respects at Kazantzakis's grave on Crete was as satisfying as seeing all of Greece's other ruins. The epitaph that Kazantzakis had requested be carved on his grave had left a profound impression on him.</p>

<p>'I desire nothing. I fear nothing. I am freedom.'</p>

<p>At that moment, Jeong reread "I am free" as "I am nirvana" and surmised that Kazantzakis might have been deeply absorbed in Buddhist thought. To desire nothing, after all, meant having laid down greed and attachment, and to fear nothing meant the extinction of anxiety and the fear of death. This would be Nirvana, the state in which the fires of all afflictions, the very causes of suffering, are completely extinguished, a realm of absolute freedom and absolute peace.</p>

<p>As the coffee in his cup began to cool, Jeong spoke.</p>

<p>"Last year, we really had no choice but to take our mentor on a cruise. It was the shared wish of his close disciples to mark his 77th birthday."</p>

<p>"I really loved the president's lectures on board the ship. I still have the notes I took."</p>

<p>"Our mentor's lectures are delivered in an elevated literary register, so that simply writing them down turns them into finely crafted sentences."</p>

<p>"I especially liked the parts where you spoke about Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Wagner, and the others."</p>

<p>"Could you show you me that notebook?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Park brought over a palm-sized notebook and showed it to Author Jeong. Across several pages, their mentor's shipboard lectures were written out in tiny, meticulous script. She appeared to be the only person who had taken notes on his lectures at sea. Jeong read the notebook carefully, paying close attention to the passages that cited the Buddhist scripture <a href="https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/dhp/dhp.intro.budd.html"><em>The Dhammapada</em></a>.</p>

<p>Schopenhauer, often called the father of German Buddhist thought and Buddhist literature, is widely known to have had two brilliant disciples, Nietzsche and Wagner. It is also well known that Wagner was a major genius composer and writer born within a Christian cultural sphere. In 1865, by composing the opera <em>The Victors</em>, he ushered in a new chapter in German Buddhist literature. Scholarly views that define the first period of German Buddhist literature as running from 1865 to 1890 likewise rest on the fact that this opera was written in 1865. Wagner's decision to title the opera <em>The Victors</em> is grounded in the following passage from the <em>Dhammapada</em>: "One who conquers oneself is the greatest of all victors. To conquer oneself is more difficult than defeating thousands of enemies on the battlefield. Neither gods nor gandharvas, neither Mara nor Brahma, can overturn the victory of one who has mastered oneself." This teaching, which clearly reveals Buddhism as a religion of self power, affirms that the true victor is not one who conquers the world but one who overcomes oneself, and it was this teaching that inspired the opera <em>The Victors</em>. The most meaningful encounter in Wagner's life was his love for Mathilde Wesendonck. He dedicated many works to her and even fashioned operatic protagonists after her. In a letter he wrote to her, Wagner once said, "Compared with the Buddhist worldview, every other dogma ends up looking foolish." It is a well known anecdote that Nietzsche wrote his celebrated work <em>The Birth of Tragedy</em> after seeing Wagner's opera <em>Tristan und Isolde</em>, and with regard to the overture of this opera Wagner himself remarked: "The only liberation is simply death, extinction, never opening one's eyes again, nothing but moving toward death, the most rapid shedding of existence, the final end of that strange realm, the joy of liberation alone." I have not invoked a renowned Western artist here in order to demonstrate how great the teachings of Shakyanumi are. How shameful it would be to check Westerners' reactions just to confirm that something of ours is excellent.'</p>

<p>It was then that Author Jeong remembered Mr. Willi, who had once lived in Tuscany, Italy for a year. This was the place where Willi withdrew at the age of forty was near the primeval forests of northern Tuscany. At the height of his fame as a composer, longing for the absolute stillness he had once realized, he left for the villa of an acquaintance in Tuscany. For the next four years, he composed nothing, living in seclusion and devoting himself to silence and contemplation. Jeong vividly remembered the voice he had heard at Willi's home in Montafon.</p>

<p>"It is a shameful story. By the time I was forty, I had, honorably, received nearly every major award available to a composer. I had fulfilled my dream as a composer. But as my name became known, I began to hear things that unsettled my heart, criticisms born of competition and envy. There were malicious rumors that Willi should no longer receive prizes, that my abilities were overrated, slanders that weighed on me. So I decided to withdraw. I discussed with my wife Marianne the idea of leaving Montafon and retreating to an unfamiliar place. Marianne was a schoolteacher, and she took a leave of absence and chose to follow me. We decided to disappear to Tuscany, Italy. The villa of an acquaintance stood in a truly secluded place, with the nearest house ten kilometers away. We lived in Tuscany for about a year, and from that time on, for four years, I deliberately refrained from composing, spending each day in prayer to the Lord and in contemplation. I devoted myself to the Lord more completely than ever before."</p>

<p>At that moment, Jeong understood Willi's confession that he had "dedicated himself to the Lord" not as meaning "to become the Lord's servant," but rather as "to lay myself down before the Lord." Without laying down the self, one could never encounter absolute stillness. In Buddhist terms, only by laying down the self, that is, by becoming selfless, could one permeate all beings in the world and become the kind of self that lives as the whole. Author Jeong said this to Mrs. Park.</p>

<p>"Let's go to Tuscany, Italy. Let's go to the place where Mr. Willi dedicated himself to the Lord."</p>

<p>"Mr. Willi originally applied for a scholarship offered in Rome so he could go there, but when he didn't get it, he went to a friend's villa in Tuscany instead. So we could go to Rome first and then stay in Tuscany, couldn't we?"</p>

<p>Author Jeong agreed. It came from the thought that he would never have another chance to go to Italy again. He made plans to spend about fifteen days in Italy and then fifteen days in Vienna, Austria.</p>

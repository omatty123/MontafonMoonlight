<p>The owner of the guesthouse expressed regret upon learning that the Author and Mrs. Jeong were leaving, perhaps having grown accustomed to their presence. She asked if they had experienced any inconveniences during their stay, toasted bread for breakfast, and even brewed coffee specially for them. Having packed their luggage neatly into their suitcases the previous evening, the couple left the guesthouse lightly. They were going to bid farewell to Mr. Willi before departing for Vienna.</p>

<p>The weather was overcast with a light mist. The dew-covered leaves seemed to foretell a warming day ahead. Mr. Willi was waiting for the couple in the garden, his silver hair damp with morning dew as if he had been out walking. Author Jeong noticed the yellow leaves scattered across the lawn overnight and turned to Mrs. Park.</p>

<p>“Honey, please take a picture.”</p>

<p>Mr. Willi, his hands tucked into the pockets of his gray jumper, approached Author Jeong. Mrs. Park remarked that the author, dressed in a dark brown modernized hanbok top and trousers, and Mr. Willi in jeans, looked surprisingly well matched. Perhaps it was not their clothing but the sympathetic expressions they shared in conversation over three nights and four days that made them seem so attuned. Author Jeong, too, felt none of the sense of foreignness often felt toward Westerners. This was because he could fully understand Mr. Willi’s philosophy of music. In truth, “musical philosophy” was not quite right; it would be more accurate to say he had come to understand Willi the man.</p>

<p>Just as Mr. Willi was about to take a photograph, he made the group laugh. It seemed that the only Korean word he knew was “kimchi.”</p>

<p>“Kimchi!”</p>

<p>The group laughed heartily and got into Dr. Werner’s car. They soon descended from St. Anton, where Mr. Willi lived, and rounded a bend in the Montafon mountains. Chairman Kwon spoke.</p>

<p>“It seems Frida sometimes comes by to help at Mr. Willi’s house. That’s reassuring.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t it be better if she moved in with Mr. Willi?”</p>

<p>Chairman Kwon replied to Mrs. Park.</p>

<p>"Frida apparently has a son from when she lived with her ex-husband. That’s why she doesn’t move in with Mr. Willi but only drops by from time to time. Frida isn’t a full-time homemaker; she’s a working woman with a career."</p>

<p>“Didn’t you say Mr. Willi had a wife?”</p>

<p>“Ah, there was a woman who had been a schoolteacher. But I heard that she and Mr. Willi came to an agreement and that she left quietly. She was a very fine woman whose father ran an orchard, but there are many things between husband and wife that no one can know.”</p>

<p>“It seems that Austrians part ways when their marriages become too uncomfortable to endure?”</p>

<p>“There is that tendency. It’s not uncommon for couples to separate yet remain friends afterward. Perhaps it’s because individualism is stronger here than in Korea.”</p>

<p>“Could it be that Mr. Willi loved music more than his wife? If so, she must have felt unbearably lonely.”</p>

<p>Author Jeong found little interest in their conversation. So he kept silent, his eyes fixed on the receding slopes of the Montafon. The car passed through the gorge and entered a long tunnel; once through it, they would leave the Montafon behind. At first glance, the Montafon’s scenery looked similar to that of other regions, yet it was unmistakably different. The green pastures and meadows were alike, but in the Montafon gorge the breath of the Alps flowed. Its high mountains held primeval glaciers and absolute stillness. To Writer Jeong, that seemed the most striking difference.</p>

<p>Once the car had completely left Montafon, Author Jeong closed his eyes. Instantly, the tasks awaiting him in Vienna flashed through his mind. The title of his upcoming lecture at the Cardinal Koenig Haus came to him, and he realized it was time to set aside all thoughts of Montafon and begin preparing his talk in his head. The title he had been given was “What Is Buddhism for Koreans?”</p>

<p>Yet the fact that such a title had been requested in a Catholic country, and specifically at the Cardinal Koenig Haus, made him wonder if it came from a place of strong faith. Otherwise, inviting a Korean novelist to speak about Korean Buddhism might have risked unsettling their own convictions.</p>

<p>In any case, Author Jeong began thinking about how to shape the opening of his lecture. Chairman Kwon, Mrs. Park, and Dr. Werner, who was driving, exchanged words from time to time, but none of it reached his ears. Once lost in thought, Jeong had the habit of immersing himself completely. Then, an idea for his opening came to him: if he began by speaking of the connection between Koreans and Austrians, it would open the hearts of the Austrians attending his lecture at the Cardinal Cultural Center. Naturally, that link was Mrs. Francesca Donner, the Austrian-born wife of Korea’s first president, Syngman Rhee. Once he had decided on the introduction, the rest of the outline quickly fell into place. Author Jeong arranged his opening in his mind.</p>

<p>&lt;I am Jeong Chanju, a novelist from Korea.</p>

<p>I thank you all for coming despite your busy schedules and for your warm welcome. I am especially grateful to the staff of the Cardinal Cultural Center for granting me this opportunity to speak, and to Ms. Sonja Steindl-Kwon, Chairwoman of IMK, for arranging it. I have long believed that Korea and Austria, though geographically distant, are emotionally close nations. This is because the wife of Korea’s first president, Syngman Rhee, was Mrs. Francesca, who was born near Vienna. I wish to share with you today that Koreans still respect and remember Mrs. Francesca, who was both wise and modest.&gt;</p>

<p>Once the opening was settled, the rest of the lecture flowed naturally, like a thread unwinding. Although the car suddenly stopped for some reason, it did not break Author Jeong’s concentration.</p>

<p>&lt;The topic of my lecture today is “What Is Buddhism for Koreans?” First, I would like to briefly introduce how Korean history began. I hope this will help you better understand today’s lecture.&gt;</p>

<p>Austria, too, must have its own founding legends of ancient kingdoms. Korea is no different. Korean history begins with Gojoseon in 2333 BCE. This is recorded in <em>Samguk Yusa</em>, a Korean historical text compiled about a thousand years ago by the monk Ilyeon. In it, he recounts the founding of Gojoseon in the following mythic form.</p>

<p>Hwanung, the son of Hwanin, the Heavenly Emperor, received three heavenly seals and descended with a retinue of three thousand to the sacred mountain Taebaeksan. Beneath the divine altar tree on its summit, he established the divine city. He appointed the Lords of Wind, Rain, and Clouds to govern the various affairs of the human world. Then, a bear and a tiger living together in the same cave came to Hwanung and prayed to become human. Hwanung gave them a handful of mugwort and twenty cloves of garlic, saying, “If you eat these for one hundred days without seeing sunlight, you will become human.”</p>

<p>The bear obeyed Hwanung’s command and became a woman after twenty-one days, while the tiger failed to do so. The bear, now a woman, prayed to Hwanung for a child. Hwanung briefly took human form and granted her wish. Their son was Dangun Wanggeom (Dangun: priest; Wanggeom: ruler), who governed Gojoseon during the era when ritual and governance were one. Thus Gojoseon became the root of Korean history, marking the beginning of five thousand years of Korean civilization.</p>

<p>Why did Venerable Ilyeon record the story of Gojoseon as a legend rather than as historical fact? In Ilyeon’s time, the Yuan dynasty of China constantly interfered with the sovereignty of Goryeo, the small Korean kingdom. Thus, conscious of China’s power, Ilyeon could only present Gojoseon’s founding as myth. To reveal the roots of Korean history was to awaken the Korean spirit, precisely what China sought to suppress.</p>

<p>Hwanung, son of Hwanin, the Heavenly Emperor, was the ruler of a powerful tribal confederation that worshipped heaven. The bear and tiger likely represented tribes that revered those animals. How could the son of Heaven marry a bear and produce a human child? It must have symbolized the union of a strong tribe with a smaller one. The tiger-worshipping tribe probably migrated elsewhere. The bear symbolizes endurance and virtue, while the tiger symbolizes courage. Koreans are the descendants of the tribe that revered the bear. Perhaps that is why Koreans so often say <em>gomapda</em> (“thank you”) rather than <em>gamsahada</em>. One theory holds that <em>gomapda</em> derives from the word “bear,” meaning “you are like a noble bear.” Thus, <em>gomapda</em> is an even more respectful expression than <em>gamsahada</em>.</p>

<p>Dr. Werner suggested that they spend the night in Krems instead of going straight to Vienna, to rest at his home on the banks of the Danube before continuing on. Mrs. Park readily agreed on behalf of Author Jeong. Jeong kept his eyes closed, fully absorbed in shaping the lecture in his mind, and took no part in their conversation.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the plane maintained an altitude of around 8,000 meters, Mrs. Park seemed to recover her usual mood, finishing her in-flight meal and even drinking a cup of coffee. Writer Jeong chose orange juice instead of coffee. Mrs. Park gazed out the window with a smile. The plane had been flying above the white clouds for several hours since departing Incheon Airport. It seemed to be flying safely in the calm zone between the troposphere and the stratosphere. Because there had not been a single abrupt change of air current, it hardly felt like they were on a plane at all. Writer Jeong spoke.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Should I try and guess what you&rsquo;re thinking about?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I was thinking of that young couple we saw at Gallery Am Park.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>Writer Jeong immediately recalled the young couple: a pair from Vienna, Austria, who had been so absorbed in the ceramics exhibition that they remained from the opening hour all the way through the reception. They drew attention when they said, &ldquo;We are poor and cannot afford the ceramics. Might you at least sell us just the catalog?&rdquo; Touched, Mrs. Park signed the catalog and gave it to them for free.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mrs. Park was a ceramic artist who created works guided solely by the sense of her hands, never using an electric wheel, and fired them in a traditional kiln fueled exclusively with pine. Her jars, in particular, gained attention: she applied white porcelain glaze only to the interior, while the exterior took on an ochre tone colored by the kiln's wood fire. She reimagined the Korean white porcelain tradition in a modern way, shaping the mouths of jars like double layers of petals or lotus leaves. Mrs. Park&rsquo;s invitational exhibition came to fruition when Director Luise Buisman of Gallery Am Park, who had been introduced to Mrs. Park&rsquo;s work through Chairman Kwon and had received her catalog, planned an international ceramics exchange.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the reception, Director Buisman surprised Writer Jeong and his wife. A former curator and designer, she appeared in a hanbok she had bought over thirty years earlier during a visit to Korea, heightening the festive mood. There was even a comic moment when Mrs. Park had to retie the ribbon of her jeogori, which Buisman had knotted like a bow tie, but the exotic striped jacket captivated the audience, including the president of the Austria&ndash;Korea Friendship Association, the head of IMK, renowned Austrian ceramicists, art critics, journalists, and others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I remember adjusting the ribbon of the director&rsquo;s jeogori that time.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I think she wore the hanbok as a way to welcome me, since I had come from Korea.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a very thoughtful person.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Ah, that reminds me of someone else. It was when you held a two-person exhibition with the Austrian ceramicist Sabine at the Cardinal Cultural Center, where you gave a lecture. I mean the middle-aged woman of aristocratic background.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;She bought one of your works at Gallery Am Park, so of course I remember her.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Writer Jeong recalled the aristocratic woman vividly, even her way of speaking. The two-person exhibition with the Austrian ceramicist Sabine at the Cardinal Cultural Center had been in the nature of an encore show. The woman came and said, &ldquo;This work is so spiritual that I still haven&rsquo;t found a place for it in my home.&rdquo; Her cherishing of the piece carried a purity like that of a teenage girl.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;One of Sabine&rsquo;s works was unusual too, an orb engraved with the words of the Dalai Lama. Though it&rsquo;s a Catholic country, there seems to be an atmosphere of respect for the Dalai Lama.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What especially impressed Writer Jeong and his wife was how Austrian art critics, along with the aristocratic woman, kept describing Mrs. Park&rsquo;s entirely handmade ceramics as &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; and &ldquo;soulful.&rdquo; In Catholic Austria, they understood that &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; in this context referred to the sacred vitality and divinity of nature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mrs. Park closed her eyes, perhaps from post-meal drowsiness. Writer Jeong suddenly cried out inwardly, &ldquo;Ah!,&rdquo; because another unforgettable person had come to mind: Dr. Werner, a physician and the husband of Chairwoman Kwon. Before the Gallery Am Park ceramics exhibition opened, he had come early to help the Jeong couple display twelve works, titled &ldquo;Joy, Memory, Heart, Blessing,&rdquo; with his keen artistic eye. Now it saddened Jeong that he could no longer meet Dr. Werner. After living cheerfully for several years following a kidney transplant, he had passed away. Jeong missed him all the more because Werner, though a doctor, painted well enough to hang his works in his living room, which made Jeong, once an aspiring painter himself, feel a sense of camaraderie.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A smile spread unconsciously across Writer Jeong's face. He recalled how he had nicknamed Dr. Werner &ldquo;Bae Hoon-a,&rdquo; a whimsical play on the name of the singer Na Hoon-a whom Werner liked, and called him &ldquo;Dr. Bae.&rdquo; Werner would then reply in Korean he had learned from his wife, Chairwoman Kwon:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cheonmaneyo</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&rdquo; (&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome.&rdquo;)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I am simply grateful for your warm hospitality.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cheonmaneyo</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Next time my wife and I come to Austria, you should hold an exhibition. Your impressionistic paintings will surely be well received.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cheonmaneyo</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Hahaha.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Writer Jeong had never seen a foreigner use &ldquo;</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cheonmaneyo</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo; with such deadpan comic flair. Once, knowing the couple&rsquo;s eating habits, Dr. Werner went shopping himself. Since Jeong avoided four-legged animals such as beef and pork, and Mrs. Park was not fond of two-legged animals like chicken or duck, he bought turkey meat and joked:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t from a four-legged animal.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never eaten turkey before, but it looks delicious. Thank you for even cooking it yourself.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cheonmaneyo</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What impressed Jeong most was that Dr. Werner never wore a watch. Jeong had never seen the doctor, whether at home or outside, with one on his wrist. Unable to contain his curiosity, he asked:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Dr. Bae, do you never wear a wristwatch?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a habit. Living as a public physician, I found I no longer needed a watch.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;But as a doctor, wouldn&rsquo;t you need a watch even more?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since his mid-forties, Jeong had been receiving regular twice-yearly checkups at Seoul&rsquo;s H General Hospital, and had never once been examined for more than five minutes. So he could not understand a doctor who did not wear a watch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;When a Korean doctor gives me even five minutes, that&rsquo;s already generous. They know I&rsquo;m a novelist. At big general hospitals with so many patients, the average person gets three minutes.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;At first, I wore a watch too. But I came to feel uneasy about fixing a set time for each patient. So I stopped wearing one, and even after retiring as a public physician, when I put on a watch my wrist feels uncomfortable.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that, Writer Jeong exclaimed inwardly, &ldquo;He truly is a bodhisattva!&rdquo; Of course, Dr. Werner had probably never heard the Buddhist word bodhisattva, nor VimalakÄ«rti&rsquo;s saying, &ldquo;Because living beings suffer, I too suffer.&rdquo; Yet Jeong believed Werner truly was one. After Dr. Werner passing, Jeong wished to visit his grave and, though late, pray for his repose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was September 15, 2015, the day after Mrs. Park&rsquo;s invitational ceramics exhibition opened at Gallery Am Park. After a brief stop at his house on the banks of the Danube in Krems, Dr. Werner drove them for eight long hours to St. Anton village in the Montafon Valley, where Herbert Willi&rsquo;s studio was located. The Jeong couple never forgot the profound gratitude they felt toward him.</span></p>

    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">It had been twenty-five years since Author Jeong ended his Seoul life and moved down to the deep southern mountains, where he built the retreat Ibuljae. Suddenly, he recalled monks he had met in Seoul. Two came first to mind. One was his teacher, the Venerable Beopjeong. Whenever Beopjeong came up from Bulil-am in Suncheon to Seoul, he would summon Jeong, as if silently urging him to someday record his words and deeds. At Beomnyeon-sa, the Seoul propagation temple of Songgwang-sa, Venerable Beopjeong once again called for him.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">From Jeong&rsquo;s workplace at Saemteo publishing company to Beomnyeon-sa was only about a 15-minute drive. Beomnyeon-sa stood right next to Gyeongbok Palace, former residence of Joseon kings. Jeong entered the room where Venerable Beopjeong was staying. Venerable Hyeonho, abbot of Beomnyeon-sa, treated Beopjeong like an elder brother in the secular world. Though Beopjeong had never once slept there, he always had a room at Beomnyeon-sa thanks to Hyeonho&rsquo;s hospitality. Inside, two guests had already arrived, one, a middle-aged woman, the other, a man who seemed to be her secretary. Venerable Beopjeong was chatting with them.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The woman spoke: &ldquo;While visiting European cathedrals last year, I thought it would be nice if there were a temple in Paris. I wanted to create a refuge for Korean expatriates and students living there, because many Koreans unaccustomed to cathedrals seemed to be adrift in Paris.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She added: &ldquo;If you build a temple in Paris, I will help with everything, from the first brick to its completion. Please allow me to do so.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When the middle-aged woman spoke, the man with her took out a notebook to write it down, but Beopjeong stopped him:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to write it. I didn&rsquo;t bring up the temple to seek help. I was just sharing the thought that came to me in Paris.&rdquo; Embarrassed, the woman grew quiet. Beopjeong then said: &ldquo;Thank you for your kind words. But temples must be built from the small offerings of many people. Only then does a sense of &lsquo;my temple&rsquo; as shared ownership arise.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The woman replied: &ldquo;You are right. My thinking was short-sighted. But please give me some chance to help, even in a small way.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beopjeong responded: &ldquo;Thank you. If you want to help me, please help Beopnyeon-sa. For it to truly serve as a propagation center, it needs a cultural hall.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Master, that is what I will do.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beopjeong declined the middle-aged woman&rsquo;s proposal for a Paris temple, instead asking her to support Beomnyeon-sa. He believed cultural facilities were necessary for it to function as a propagation temple. He also shared an anecdote: when the Dalai Lama visited Europe, a priest asked him, &ldquo;What is Buddhist compassion?&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;kindness.&rdquo; Beopjeong remarked that most Korean monks were thought to be unkind, thus lacking compassion. He noted that Europeans were drawn to Buddhism as a way of self-salvation without reliance on God, and expressed his wish to build a temple of kindness in Paris. Later, Jeong heard from Venerable Hyeonho that this woman was the wife of the chairman of a conglomerate.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Another monk was a young man who had come after reading Jeong&rsquo;s essay collection </span><span class="c4 c5">The Road to the Hermitage</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and was spreading Buddhism among the British. He was very calm, radiating serenity. When he visited Jeong at Saemteo around lunchtime and Jeong offered to treat him to a meal, he declined with a smile, saying he had just eaten the lunchbox he had brought at a nearby park stand. While talking with him in the company cafe, Jeong came to understand the reality of the British church: many stood empty, and one of them had been rented inexpensively to convert into a temple and carry out propagation.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Empty churches in England? That surprises me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Not only in England. My dharma brother in Germany has also obtained an empty church to spread Buddhism. There are more Westerners attracted to Buddhism than you might think.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">By September 10, Jeong had resolved to go to Austria. The two monks had indeed inspired him. If he could give a lecture to Europeans newly interested in Buddhism on &ldquo;What Buddhism means to Koreans,&rdquo; his trip would be even more meaningful. Since Jeong was not a Buddhist scholar, he thought it would be easier and less burdensome to introduce how Koreans had engaged with Buddhism from ancient times, rather than lecture on doctrine or history.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jeong immediately emailed Chairwoman Kwon, asking if he could give a lecture to Austrians and Korean expatriates. A few days later, he received a reply: a lecture had been scheduled at Vienna&rsquo;s Kardinal K&ouml;nig Haus, where no Korean had ever lectured before, and they asked for his topic. The venue was comparable to the cultural center of Myeongdong Cathedral in Korea. Jeong then replied by explaining in two points why he had chosen &ldquo;What Buddhism means to Koreans&rdquo; as his lecture theme.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jeong answered that he chose his topic on &ldquo;What Buddhism means to Koreans&rdquo; for two reasons: first, because explaining the emotional outlook of Koreans would be helpful to Austrians; second, because introducing Buddhism, which was gaining heightened interest among Westerners, would also be meaningful. Jeong then discussed the travel schedule with his wife, Mrs. Park.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;More than two weeks would be hard because of the serialized novel.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If we leave September 10, we can return on the 25th.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I was only thinking about my lecture. How about you hold a ceramics exhibition as well?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mrs. Park readily accepted Jeong&rsquo;s proposal to hold a ceramics exhibition in Vienna. Moreover, since she already had works fired in her wood kiln from the previous autumn, it would not be difficult to stage an exhibition right away. Of course, if a gallery were set, there would still be issues of transporting the works to Vienna and producing a catalog, but those were only secondary matters.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jeong sent Chairwoman Kwon a text message about the travel dates and Mrs. Park&rsquo;s ceramics exhibition. A few days later, a reply came: Jeong&rsquo;s lecture at the Kardinal K&ouml;nig Haus (KKH) was scheduled for September 20; Mrs. Park&rsquo;s ceramics exhibition could be held as an invitational show at Galerie Am Park in central Vienna from September 14 to 18, coinciding with an international exhibition; and on the 20th, at KKH, she could also hold a two-person show with Austrian ceramicist Sabine Bauer.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, Chairwoman Kwon insisted that on September 15, the day after the opening at Galerie Am Park, they go to Montafon to meet Mr. Willy. She had arranged lodging next to his studio and proposed staying for at least three nights and four days. The drive from Vienna to Montafon would take eight hours, with her husband, physician Dr. Werner Stockinger, driving. Since this was the very reason she had invited Jeong, other plans were postponed.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Chairwoman Kwon also requested that the couple remain until September 26 to attend IMK&rsquo;s annual concert at Vienna&rsquo;s Musikverein Golden Hall. This charity event invited elderly Austrians who rarely experienced classical music, allowing them to experience Korean filial piety through music. This year&rsquo;s performers included Chinese pianist Shiran Wang (&#29579;&#35433;&#28982;) and a young Korean violinist. Mrs. Park, a classical music enthusiast, said they must extend their trip to attend the IMK concert.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;When else will we ever hear music in the Golden Hall?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We only need to delay our return by three days, so let&rsquo;s do it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the end, the Austria trip was extended to eighteen days. Jeong began drafting his lecture in spare moments, while Mrs. Park set to work on the exhibition catalog. Fortunately, South Jeolla Province had a program supporting artists&rsquo; overseas exhibitions, which provided funding for the catalog. She chose the theme &ldquo;Beauty of Korea&rdquo; for her show, and hired a photographer to capture her ceramics not only at her traditional wood-fired kiln but also against the scenic backdrops of Hwasun&rsquo;s Jeokbyeok cliffs, Unju-sa, Ssangbongs-a, and Boseong&rsquo;s Yulpo Beach and tea fields. The intent was to present modernized Korean ceramics set within Korea&rsquo;s beautiful landscapes to the Austrian audience.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before long, Jeong&rsquo;s trip to Austria had taken on three purposes: meeting Mr. Willy at Chairwoman Kwon&rsquo;s urging, giving his lecture, and Mrs. Park&rsquo;s ceramics exhibition.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c5">To be continued</span></p>

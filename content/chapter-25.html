<p>Gazing at the Island of Elba</p>

<p>The express train from Termini Station, said to have been a public bathhouse in Roman times, took two hours to reach Follonica, a small coastal town in Tuscany. The station plaza was quiet. The palm fronds, like peacock feathers, looked fresh and vibrant.</p>

<p>"Sweetheart, perhaps it's the feel of the word 'Tuscany,' but unlike Rome, this place feels warm and familiar."</p>

<p>"I feel the same. Did you see those endless wheat fields on the way? They reminded me of the countryside where we live."</p>

<p>"I also have the feeling that Mr. Willi guided us here."</p>

<p>The bungalow they had reserved at Golfo del Sole was about a fifteen-minute drive from the station. In Italian, golfo means "gulf" and sole means "sun," so it was a bungalow on the "Gulf of the Sun." The public parking lot behind the station was named "Tiananmen Victims Square." The "Tiananmen Incident" referred to the tragic event of June 4, 1989, when Chinese martial law troops deployed tanks to forcibly disperse students, workers, and citizens demonstrating for democracy in Tiananmen Square, firing upon them and causing many casualties. Because of the Italians' strong sense of human rights, Author Jeong felt himself growing even more familiar with Tuscany. Perhaps it was a sentiment shared only by the people of Gwangju, who had directly or indirectly experienced the noble fury of the May 18th Uprising.</p>

<p>After unpacking at the bungalow, Author Jeong and his wife walked up along the seaside promenade. When sweat began to bead on their foreheads, the path came to a dead end, and they spotted a medieval relic, a torre, meaning watchtower or tower. Next to the Torre Mozza Hotel, built adjoining the watchtower, stood a small café. Upon entering, they had a much better view of Elba Island, elongated like a sweet potato. It was the island where Napoleon had lived in exile. When they asked how to get there, the café manager explained that one could take a ferry from the port of Piombino to the north and disembark at Porto Ferraio on Elba, but warned that the ferry schedules had to align well to avoid wasting time.</p>

<p>Author Jeong's interest in Napoleon was not merely due to his dramatic rise from rags to riches. He was curious about the charm that had captivated the artists of his time. Beethoven, too, had been enchanted by Napoleon. This was when Napoleon's valor was shaking all of Europe. Beethoven heard stories of Napoleon from the French ambassador stationed in Vienna and his secretary, the violinist Rodolphe Kreutzer, and was so stirred that he could not contain himself. Having just been moved by Plato's <em>Republic</em>, Beethoven wished to praise Napoleon as the hero of the age. Thus he composed his <em>Symphony No. 3, the Eroica</em>. Yet the bond between Beethoven and Napoleon ended there. Just as Beethoven was about to send the score of his Third Symphony through the French Embassy, news spread through Vienna that Napoleon had crowned himself Emperor. Beethoven, who had hoped Napoleon would become a hero of the people, tore up the manuscript copy he had intended to send and cried out:</p>

<p>So he is no more than a common mortal! Now, too, he will tread under foot all the rights of man, indulge only his ambition; now he will think himself superior to all men, become a tyrant!"</p>

<p>In any case, it was not only Beethoven who helped make Napoleon a legend; novelists also played their part. Stendhal often made Bonapartists his protagonists. In his masterpiece <em>Le Rouge et le Noir </em>(The Red and the Black), he defended the Napoleonic era through his characters, who declared they would rather fight in a red military uniform than wear a hypocritical black cassock. Victor Hugo, whose father had been a general in Napoleon's army, also depicted the valor of Napoleon's forces in his novel <em>Les Misérables</em>.</p>

<p>Napoleon was born on the remote French island of Corsica. To escape poverty, he entered the military academy at Brienne at age ten and became an artillery officer at sixteen. Eight years later, his victory against the British at the Battle of Toulon earned him a special promotion to brigadier general, making him a hero of the French Revolutionary Army overnight. After suppressing forces opposing the National Convention with cannon fire, he was appointed commander of the Italian campaign. In his early thirties, he ascended to the throne as Emperor of France, conquering half of Europe with unstoppable momentum and establishing France's systems of education, religion, culture, and law. However, his reckless Russian campaign failed, and the ensuing aftermath of war led to a coup. Napoleon was exiled to the island of Elba, and Louis XVIII, a relative of Louis XVI, returned to Paris. But Louis XVIII acted like an absolute monarch in the manner of Louis XIV and lost popular support. The people longed for Napoleon, and dreaming of a comeback, Napoleon escaped from Elba and reappeared as a hero of the masses. Soon after, seeking to secure his political footing, Napoleon waged a fateful battle at Waterloo against the allied forces led by British General Wellington and the Prussian General Blücher. But Napoleon was defeated in bitter futility, and his magnificent era came to an end. He was exiled once more, this time to the forsaken island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic, where on the stormy dawn of May 5, 1821, at five o'clock, he closed his eyes forever.</p>

<p>Author Jeong suddenly recalled Napoleon's murmured words from his second place of exile on Saint Helena: "My life is like a novel! When I die, a wave of pity for me will surge." Napoleon's prophecy was being proven in the years after his death: over 600,000 novels, biographies, studies, essays, and papers have been written about him.</p>

<p>Gazing at Elba Island, Author Jeong and his wife ate gelato. They were coming to realize that Italy truly was a nation of food. The variety of wheat-based foods, breads, spaghetti, and other dishes, was remarkable, and after every meal, gelato was an essential dessert. It was a perfect match for Author Jeong's palate, as he loved noodles and sweets. After their meal, they set out for the old castle town of Massa Marittima, about forty minutes by car from Follonica. Both Follonica and Massa Marittima were small towns (<em>comuni</em>) in the province of Grosseto.</p>

<p>Massa Marittima, designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site, was about the size of a Korean township, yet it contained hotels, restaurants, a piazza, a cathedral, cafés, clothing shops, and antique stores. All the alleys, paved with smooth stones and steps, led upward toward the fortress. When they entered an antique shop, the owner said that the Jeong couple were the first Koreans to visit. Since group tourists did not come here, it was only natural. The owner said:</p>

<p>"Besides here, there are many tranquil old castle towns throughout the Tuscany region."</p>

<p>"Even before the period when the Republics of Pisa, Siena, and Florence were vying with one another, people must have built fortresses on mountain peaks and formed villages there, since such locations were easier to defend against enemies."</p>

<p>After climbing up to the fortress and descending through the alleys, they reached the Piazza del Duomo, where the Cathedral of Massa Marittima stood tall. Said to have been constructed in the twelfth century, the cathedral was itself a museum. Upon entering, frescoes painted in the medieval period captured their attention right away. The fresco of Mary holding the infant Jesus was well preserved. A marble sarcophagus bearing the inscription "Gregorius" was intricately carved, and the description noted it had been made in 1324. On the street, they had seen a sculpture of a lamb bearing a cross on its back, and the same image was carved in relief on the cathedral's marble wall, as if it were the emblem of the old castle town of Massa Marittima.</p>

<p>The most famous Catholic saint from Massa Marittima was said to be Bernardino, who was active in the fifteenth century. He entered the Franciscan Order in 1402 and worked as a preacher, devising the monogram "I.H.S." - the first three letters of Jesus's name in Greek rendered in Roman letters. He greatly influenced the reform of the Franciscan Order and earned the title "Doctor of the Assumption" for his studies on the Virgin Mary. It was easy to see why the local people took such pride in him.</p>

<p>When they returned to the piazza, retired elders were engaged in heated debate. One old man was delivering a passionate speech, apparently discussing Italian politics. It seemed that Italian elders, like Koreans, had a keen interest in politics. One of them gestured for Author Jeong to join the discussion. But Jeong declined and headed down below the old castle of Massa Marittima. He had once read an article about a peculiar fresco discovered in 2000 on the wall of a communal well. A net had been installed to protect it from bird droppings, and upon actually seeing it, the fresco was indeed quite explicit. Estimated to have been created around 1265, the mural featured a tree with abundant branches at its center, from which hung twenty-five phalluses and testicles. People called it the "Tree of Fertility." Author Jeong could not help but laugh at the thought of women coming to draw water from the well and praying for fertility upon seeing the male organs. Moreover, one woman in the fresco appeared to be reaching up with a stick as if to pluck a phallus. Such a depiction of phalluses and testicles hanging in clusters was unprecedented in medieval Western art. Since the fresco dated from a period of competition between the Holy Roman Empire and the Papacy, its precise intent and meaning remained a mystery to this day. However, in Author Jeong's view, it seemed more plausible to interpret the mural as a prayer for fertility and abundance rather than as a political statement.</p>

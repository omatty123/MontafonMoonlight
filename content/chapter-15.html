<p>The group had lunch at a service station halfway between Montafon and Krems. Though it was a buffet restaurant, the menu was disappointing. Author Jeong and Mrs. Park took bread and vegetable salad, eating bread again after having had it for breakfast. As they didn't care for meat, there wasn't much else to eat. The spaghetti vongole they'd had in Montafon wasn't on the buffet. While Dr. Werner filled the car with gas, Chairman Kwon remarked,</p>
<p>"You must be tired. You've had your eyes closed ever since we left Montafon."</p>
<p>"Not at all. I was organising my thoughts for the lecture at the Cardinal Culture Center."</p>
<p>"We've been chatting all this time. Were you really able to concentrate?"</p>
<p>Mrs. Park chimed in.</p>
<p>"When my husband focuses on a thought, he pays no attention to those around him."</p>
<p>"Ah, I see. That could be it."</p>
<p>“Shall we take Mr Willi as an example? He mentioned hearing various sounds twenty-four hours a day, even during sleep, didn’t he? Yet it is as if he has been working on his own music within that. Things are happening all around him, but they do not interfere with his focus on his own thoughts. Perhaps that is on a different level from concentration or immersion. When one is truly concentrated or immersed, it becomes impossible to take in what is going on around one.”</p>
<p>Chairman Kwon asked with a smile.</p>
<p>"When Mr. Willi says he hears sounds 24 hours a day, it pains me. How tormented he must be?"</p>
<p>"In my view, he isn't tormented. The sounds merely exist. They offer Mr. Willi no stimulation whatsoever. Nor do they hinder his composing."</p>
<p>"Is that possible?"</p>
<p>"It is a state that goes a level beyond concentration or immersion. In Buddhism, this is called samadhi. When one enters samadhi, one can still take in what is happening around one while devoting oneself fully to one’s work. In that sense, Mr. Willi is in samadhi twenty-four hours a day."</p>
<p>"Was Author Jeong also in samadhi just now?"</p>
<p>“I’ve never been in samadhi for an entire day. But I have often entered it briefly when writing. I heard everything Chairman Kwon and Dr. Werner said just now. Yet my single thought was not disturbed at all, that thought being the organisation of my lecture content. Shall I tell you what Chairman Kwon and Dr. Werner talked about?”</p>
<p>“It wasn’t particularly important.”</p>
<p>“Before going to the Krems house we talked about stopping at the supermarket, since Author Jeong doesn’t eat meat from four-legged animals we should buy turkey; before moving Mrs. Park’s work from the Ampark Gallery to the hall where Author Jeong will lecture we should meet Sabine first to discuss it, and so on.”</p>
<p>It was Chairman Kwon’s idea for Mrs. Park to hold a two-person exhibition with the Austrian ceramic artist Sabine at the venue where Author Jeong would lecture. Since he knew Sabine he planned a joint East–West ceramics exhibition. The venue would be empty for the day so holding an exhibition there presented no difficulty.</p>
<p>At last the car entered the town center of Krems. It was the first time Author Jeong and his wife had seen it. Their first impression was that it was historic and quiet. The old brick buildings all had a weighty look. It resembled the streets of Gyeongju, Korea’s ancient capital. The group saw the town only through the car windows before going directly to a large supermarket. The ingredients were mainly bought by the meticulous and careful Dr. Werner. As if wanting to make a good impression on the author, Dr. Werner said:</p>
<p>"Author, a turkey is not a four-legged animal."</p>
<p>"Thank you."</p>
<p>"Not at all."</p>
<p>However, buying a turkey did not satisfy both guests from Korea. Mrs. Park did not eat meat from creatures with two legs, such as chicken or duck. Yet, Author Jeong did not mention Mrs. Park's dietary habits to Dr. Werner. The doctor’s kindness meant more to him than Mrs. Park’s dietary preferences.</p>
<p>Dr. Werner and his wife's house lay on the outskirts of Krems. Only after passing orchards, farms, and a couple of small villages did their detached house appear. Opposite stood the banks of the Danube. Its location, removed from the village, gave it the feel of a secluded, quiet retreat. After Dr. Werner entered first, the Jeong couple lingered outside for a moment, admiring the peaceful surroundings. Chairman Kwon remarked,</p>
<p>"This house was originally an annex to the monastery. Dr. Werner acquired it through a close priest friend at the monastery."</p>
<p>"I sensed that immediately."</p>
<p>"The monastery found it difficult to maintain, hence the sale. The building visible on the hill over there is the monastery itself, though it's quite a distance away."</p>
<p>Dr. Werner had informed Chairman Kwon that he had roughly tidied the house. However, upon gazing at the garden, the writer couple were startled. The Korean national flag [called the Taegeukgi] was hoisted on the flagpole. It was clear Dr. Werner had gone in first to raise it. Author Jeong felt his heart swell, as if he were receiving a state guest’s welcome. The Taegeukgi waved gently in the river breeze.</p>
<p>Only upon entering the living room of Dr. Werner and his wife's house did Author Jeong express his gratitude to Dr. Werner.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Doctor."</p>
<p>"Not at all."</p>
<p>“If you were to visit Korea, Doctor, I would erect a flagpole at my residence and hoist the Austrian flag.”</p>
<p>Chairman Kwon responded to Author Jeong’s words.</p>
<p>“That is a splendid idea. Should Mr. Willi also visit Author Jeong’s residence, I imagine he would be most pleased if the Austrian flag were displayed.”</p>
<p>“Of course. Whenever guests arrive from abroad, I intend to fly their nation’s flag.”</p>
<p>Dr. Werner prepared the turkey dish at the sink. Meanwhile, Author Jeong admired the landscape paintings by Dr. Werner hanging in the hallway and living room. They were oil paintings in an Impressionist style. The color combinations and brushwork were skillful for amateur work. While eating the turkey dish at dinner, Author Jeong said to Dr. Werner.</p>
<p>"Next time my wife and I visit, I hope to see your work exhibited in a gallery. I sincerely hope you hold a solo exhibition."</p>
<p>"They're just paintings done as a hobby; I'm not sure they're worthy of exhibition."</p>
<p>"Actually, I too loved painting enough to be in the art club until high school. I copied Van Gogh's paintings a lot."</p>
<p>"So we share that affinity, Author Jeong. But I'll give the solo exhibition more thought."</p>
<p>After dinner, Dr. Werner guided Author Jeong and his wife to the banks of the Danube. The riverbank lay right at the edge of their garden and their vegetable patch. Standing on the embankment, the Danube flowing through the outskirts of Krems didn’t appear particularly wide. A reed bed along the riverbank made it seem even narrower. A sharp river breeze blew in, making it impossible to sit on the bench for long. Mrs. Park was rather sensitive to the cold.</p>
<p>Chairman Kwon offered the couple a room on the second floor. There was a small sitting room with a sofa upstairs too. Mrs. Park went into the bathroom and ran a warm bath, while Author Jeong continued developing the lecture outline he'd conceived on the journey to Krems. This time, he focused on the Korean peoples' love of peace and their distinct identity.</p>
<p>&lt;Korea has historically endured countless invasions from China and Japan. Geographically, China and Japan could only expand their territories by occupying Korea. Despite this, Korea has never once invaded China or Japan. Koreans have never attacked other nations; even when wronged, they have endured like bears, loving only peace.</p>
<p>There is another reason I take pride as a Korean. Despite frequent invasions, Korea was never absorbed or assimilated into the culture of any great power. I am proud that Korea has maintained its unique identity and developed its own distinct culture. Korea possesses its own language, used exclusively by Koreans, and the highly scientific and original script, hangeul. When China exerted diplomatic influence over Korea, Chinese characters were used; when Japan forcibly occupied and ruled Korea, Japanese characters were used. Yet today, all Koreans use hangeul, created five hundred years ago during the Joseon Dynasty by King Sejong the Great and the monk Sinmi. As a writer who composes novels in my mother tongue, hangeul, I have always held a profound interest in it. It was this motivation that led me to publish the novel <em>The Moon Reflected in Thousand Rivers</em>, which unravels the secrets behind the creation of hangeul.&gt;</p>
<p>After a cursory wash of hands and feet, Author Jeong lay down on the bed and continued his lecture. Mrs. Park, evidently exhausted, soon drifted off to sleep.</p>
<p>&lt;To be continued&gt;</p>

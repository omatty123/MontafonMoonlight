<p>Author Jeong received an important manuscript by email from Chairwoman Kwon. It was a book length manuscript recording an interview in which Martin Skamletz, a former student who studied composition under Mr. Willi documented his teacher’s “musical life.” Skamletz was a lecturer in music theory and the director of the Institute for Interpretive Research at the Bern University of the Arts. The interview was presumably conducted in German, but Chairwoman Kwon graciously sent Jeong a Korean translation so he could read it.</p>

<p>While reviewing the Korean translation, Author Jeong discovered something new: Mr. Willi’s interest in composition began around the time he met Ms. Marianne. Meanwhile, the manuscript laid out in detail Willi’s reasons for going to Italy. The narrative was organized into childhood, boyhood, youth, and adulthood, and the adulthood section’s year 1986 began like this:</p>

<p>“I got married that August. I had known Marianne for several years. I first met her at a dance held during the village festival in Schruns in the Montafon Valley. At the time, she was attending grammar school (Gymnasium) in Feldkirch, and I was studying in Innsbruck, aiming to become an orchestral musician. I saw her at the dance, approached her, and we danced together for an hour or two. We barely spoke. Then one day, I took her home, and we stayed together from then on. This was in the late 1970s. Until then, I had never even considered becoming a composer. At the time, Marianne knew much more about contemporary music than I did. She often went to concerts featuring contemporary music. Of course, there were days when she went with me to such concerts, too.</p>

<p>At some point, I began studying composition, and my wife became a teacher, teaching German and music at a secondary school. After we were married, as I spent several years building my career as a composer, she encouraged me, stood firmly by my side, and always understood me while I was composing or traveling for performances. In short, she was an excellent wife."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in 1987, Willi was invited by Father Nathaniel to a concert held at the Abbey of St. Gerold. It was early May 1987. The conductor of the concert orchestra was Rudolf Baumgartner, whom Willi met again over dinner and spoke with at length. Baumgartner showed a quiet interest in Willi’s compositions and asked about his musical plans. This interest reflected the fact that Willi was gradually gaining recognition as a composer.</p>

<p>In 1987, Willi’s piece, together with a work by Beat Furrer, won first prize in a competition hosted by the Vienna Konzerthaus, judged and performed by the Arditti Quartet. The Arditti Quartet was a string quartet founded in 1974 under the leadership of the British violinist Irvine Arditti. Willi’s piece was premiered by the Arditti Quartet, becoming one of the first steps that carried his music onto a larger stage. It marked the first performance of his work outside the state of Vorarlberg, and newspapers and broadcasters praised it as “a musical application of the laws of nature.” It was also at this time that he met Alexander Pereira, then Secretary General of the Vienna Konzerthaus and later director of the Zurich Opera House.</p>

<p>It was only seven months after meeting Rudolf Baumgartner that he invited Willi to Zurich in early December 1987. Although Willi had received a scholarship from the Austrian government to go to Rome, he was looking for a quiet place in Italy instead of a large city. Rather than exposing his now-recognized music to praise and envy, he wished to live quietly in silence, as he had done in Montafon.</p>

<p>"We met in Zurich and had a long, in depth conversation. We spoke for hours about many interests, not only music. It was then that I also came to know his wife. She was a sculptor from a wealthy family and often spent time at Japanese Buddhist temples. Her mother was a woman who had studied medicine at a Swiss university.</p>

<p>The Baumgartners owned a villa in Tuscany, Italy, though they did not live there. Baumgartner suggested that instead of going to Rome, I stay at his villa and compose there. I had no reason to object. In early January 1988, I took several days with my wife, Marianne, and visited. After that, everything was decided quickly. Marianne decided to take a one year leave of absence and we moved to Tuscany in February 1988.</p>

<p>Mr. Willi thus decided to stay at Baumgartner’s villa rather than go to Rome, judging that the broad plains of Tuscany, though geographically different from the mountainous Montafon, were quiet and appealing. Baumgartner, of course, had lent him the villa in anticipation of Willi’s compositions, and he even came in April, staying for several days in order to see the works Willi had written.</p>

<p>Born in Zurich, Switzerland, in 1917, Rudolf Baumgartner was thirty nine years older than Willi, belonging to his father’s generation. He was a conductor and violinist who co-founded and long led the Lucerne Festival Strings, a chamber orchestra established in 1956 together with the Austrian violinist Wolfgang Schneiderhan. He also served as director of the Lucerne Conservatory and as artistic director of the Lucerne Festival from 1969 to 1980.</p>

<p>"Baumgartner looked over my work and evaluated it positively. As a result, I remained there throughout 1988. He also commissioned me to compose a piece for the Lucerne Festival Strings, and the outcome was my cello concerto.</p>

<p>In the end, I couldn't receive the Rome scholarship. I gave it up myself. I had resolved to secure complete silence within the time and space of rural Tuscany. As a child, I had been forced into silence in hospitals, but now I wanted to return voluntarily to absolute silence and listen for how music emerged within me. That was the criterion by which I would decide whether to become a freelance composer. Even while traveling, lecturing, rehearsing, and performing, my guiding principle was to withdraw for long periods into complete silence in order to compose. Those around me did not understand my wish to live as a freelance composer. But I have come to know, then and now, that this was my path. I have never regretted or doubted my decision. Doctors said I would die, but I did not. What then should I fear?"</p>

<p>Rudolf Baumgartner’s villa in Tuscany was located in a secluded rural area roughly halfway between Florence and Siena.</p>

<p>The nearest town where one could shop and receive mail, was some eight kilometers away, making it a truly remote location. Yet the villa itself was extraordinary. In the main building were a music room with a large table, a fireplace, and a harpsichord, the keyboard instrument regarded as the forerunner of the piano, as well as a vast reading room with a great hall housing an extensive record collection. Before the villa’s garden stretched large vineyards, Etruscan tombs, and an old chapel built in harmonious proportions, into which the noon sunlight of the spring equinox streams through a round window. At the villa, I could listen to music in exactly the atmosphere I desired, and I found not only the inner and outer peace necessary for composition, but also the ability to immerse myself in a spiritual world rich with inspiration.</p>

<p>“On the first night, I could not sleep because the sound of the nightingales was so loud. It felt as though hundreds of them were singing.”</p>

<p>It was the sound of hundreds of nightingales singing as they moved across the Tuscan hills. The barren hills and vast forests surrounding the villa were their natural habitat.</p>

<p>“While staying at the villa, I took long walks for several months. I encountered many hedgehogs, wild boars, and snakes. The forest was dense, and the mountain paths were difficult to find. Rotting fallen oak trees and ravines often brought my steps to a halt. The landscape, seemingly untouched by human hands, felt like ‘primordial nature.’ From the moment I encountered this absolute silence of nature, I began to discover an inner absolute silence. I came to uncover the primal nature within me, long confined by education and religion, and to find my original self.”</p>

<p>However, Willi did not remain solely within this primal nature. Whenever the urge arose to step away from it, he went to Siena rather than Florence.</p>

<p>“I loved Siena’s Piazza del Campo. I even joined the crowds at the Palio, one of the most thrilling horse races in the world, held in the Campo at the heart of the old city.”</p>

<p>The Palio horse race held in Siena’s Piazza del Campo took place twice each year. A four day festival was held on July 2 and August 16, with the horse race itself occurring on the final day. <em>To be continued</em></p>

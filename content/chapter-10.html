<p dir="auto">On the day of my second meeting with Mr. Willi, Mrs. Park joined us. She preferred hearing Mr. Willi&rsquo;s stories to touring Montafon with Dr. Werner. The place for our talk with Mr. Willi was the same as the day before. In the living room on the second floor of his home, Mr. Willi, Author Jeong, Chairman Kwon, and Mrs. Park sat around a round table. In the middle of the table, as before, there was a clear glass teapot filled with lemon tea. They began by sharing a cup of lemon tea. This time, Author Jeong spoke first.</p>
<p dir="auto">Mr. Willi said he does not compose with his intellect but writes down the sounds of Montafon&rsquo;s nature, and I think I understand what he meant. Works gained by an author&rsquo;s will or effort are of a lower order; what writers truly seek are works that surpass effort, those born of inspiration. I often have the same experience. When fixing a novel&rsquo;s title or shaping its plan, no matter how hard I try at my desk, it often will not come, and then one dawn it flickers through my mind. It rises in that instant just after waking, when I sit without a thought, eyes barely open. I have often settled on the title that brushed my mind then, and I was usually satisfied. So it felt less like something I earned through effort than a gift of inspiration, as if the talents of all had converged. And I think such inspiration is not a coincidence but an inevitability that appears when a connection has fully ripened.</p>
<p dir="auto">Resting his chin on his hand, Mr. Willi listened intently and then began to share his own experience. Since it was her second day, Chairman Kwon&rsquo;s interpreting came more quickly and naturally. Mrs. Park set down a thumb-sized recorder to record the conversation between Mr. Willi and Author Jeong.</p>
<p dir="auto">&ldquo;I agree with you, Author Jeong. I compose from a distinctive inspiration. I have written very few pieces after deciding in advance what to compose or fixing content and form beforehand. I simply meet the music that the nature of Montafon and the Alps gives and write it down as it is. My music was already there, living on those mountain slopes; I only discovered it. Even now I could take you to several places where I heard those songs. When I was young, there was Lake Kopssee in the valleys of high mountains that people seldom visited because it was a protected area. It was so distant and the trails so dangerous that for decades few went there. Below the lake there is a primeval forest, and in that forest there was an ancient stillness. Music lived there.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="auto">&ldquo;Is that primordial stillness the absolute silence you&rsquo;ve spoken of many times?&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="auto">"Yes, that's where music resides. It's not just living things like trees and grass that exist there&mdash;music lives there too. Let me say again, Author Jeong, I can show you exactly where music lives. Even now, music dwells in that place. As long as people don't pollute it, music will live there forever. That&rsquo;s why I always carry colored pencils and paper in my pocket."</p>
<p dir="auto">&ldquo;Colored pencils? What connection do they have with music?&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="auto">&ldquo;I do not hear the music there, I see it. That is why I draw the music I see with colored pencils. I sketch the music on paper and bring it home. Then, one day, within the stillness of my own mind, I look at the music I have drawn and complete the composition.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="auto">At this, Author Jeong was speechless. The thought of seeing sound rather than hearing it made him wonder, &ldquo;Can such a thing truly be possible?&rdquo; But Mr. Willi, as if to prove his words, gave an example.</p>
<p dir="auto">&ldquo;In the deep valleys of Montafon or the gorges of the Alps, places inaccessible when the weather turns, dwells a music for an orchestra of a hundred or more. Should the opportunity arise, I would like to take you there, Author Jeong. It is the very place where I once translated that music onto paper with my colored pencils. Of course, even without going to such a place, I could simply sit down for a week or several weeks and, through sheer effort, compose something of a similar nature. But in my view, the result would not be music. I believe that music conceived in the human mind and constructed through mathematical calculation is inherently artificial; it can never possess the pure space and profound depth of the music that simply <em>is</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="auto">"Is that so? As I mentioned earlier, music composed with the mind is inferior; music that captures the sounds of nature is surely of a heavenly caliber."</p>
<p dir="auto">Mr. Willi seemed to brighten as Author Jeong showed understanding. Encouraged, he began to confess his innermost thoughts without reserve.</p>
<p dir="auto">"I never wanted to waste a single second&mdash;then or now&mdash;in my task of transcribing music. To seek it out, I left home and lived for years in a hut deep in the Montafon valleys, and for several more in singular places like Tuscany. I was waiting, you see, because in waiting, I could find the silence of the external world. But one day, I realized that same silence existed within me. It was a moment of revelation: &lsquo;So, there is a silence inside me, too.&rsquo; An absolute silence, one might call it. And it is within that silence that music begins. This music was never something I could summon at will. It was, in other words, entirely beyond my jurisdiction. I could neither dictate its beginning nor its end. So, you see, even if an orchestra conductor requests a piece of twenty-five or forty minutes, or even if I myself desire to create one, music cannot be conjured by technical skill alone. What I call my composition is only complete when I encounter a force greater than myself, a state of absolute stillness."</p>
<p dir="auto">&ldquo;I understand, from a Buddhist point of view, how your music comes into being, Mr. Willi. What you call the absolute stillness or absolute silence within is what Buddhism calls <em>kong</em> (空), emptiness. Emptiness is a state that is completely void yet somehow full. We call it &lsquo;the fullness of emptiness.&rsquo; To say that the inside is empty means that all human desires are gone. This is called <em>jeongmyeol</em> (寂滅), or <em>jin'gong</em> (眞空). Buddhism teaches that wisdom arises from this empty state. It seems that you, Mr. Willi, perceive that wisdom emerging from emptiness as sound.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="auto">Moved by Author Jeong&rsquo;s interpretation, Mr. Willi&rsquo;s eyes filled with tears. Chairman Kwon rose, went to him, and briefly embraced him to calm him. Author Jeong thought Mr. Willi resembled an Eastern Seon master, for he was already meeting music within the absolute stillness of inner emptiness, the realm of enlightenment reached by Seon masters. Mr. Willi&rsquo;s confession continued.</p>
<p dir="auto">&ldquo;There were times when I roamed the Montafon slopes and wandered the deep Alpine valleys in search of absolute stillness, absolute silence. But one day I realized that the place itself was me, and I found it within. Nature and I were one. After I discovered absolute stillness within myself, ten years passed, and then I could reach that same stillness even on the noisiest highway. Once, for example, there was a clarinet piece. I had kept for years a sheet I had sketched in colored pencil at the place where that music lived. After I met the absolute stillness within me, I completed that composition in an instant. It was a work commissioned by the Salzburg Festival.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="auto">Perhaps the exchange between Mr. Willi and Author Jeong had grown too solemn, for Chairman Kwon changed the subject.</p>
<p dir="auto">&ldquo;Tourism is Montafon&rsquo;s main source of income, isn&rsquo;t it? That means you need many tourists. I read in the paper that you intend to open even the remotest mountain valleys to attract them, is that true?&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="auto">&ldquo;There is talk of opening up even the last valleys of Montafon, of holding mountain marathons and building bicycle paths. They even asked me to help with the development. I am worried, because the music that lives there might be driven away. So I told the city authorities not to do such things, and they all laughed at me.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="auto">Author Jeong joined their conversation.</p>
<p dir="auto">&ldquo;Those who live only within the visible world could never understand, could they?&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="auto">&ldquo;I opposed it, but a few years later they held the mountain marathon anyway. Since then, it has taken place every July. The music I once encountered has left the marathon course and now dwells deep within the mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="auto">&ldquo;So the music that once lived peacefully within absolute stillness has gone into exile.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="auto">&ldquo;Yes. Even if everyone mocks me, I hold absolute faith and reverence for the music that lives in the mountains. But the places where that music dwells are growing rarer, because nature is being destroyed. Even in Montafon, the damage to nature is severe. Still, perhaps it&rsquo;s a small blessing amid misfortune, there are a few places where music still lives, within fifty kilometers of the village valleys. Yet before long, we&rsquo;ll have to go deeper and deeper into the gorges to find it, into places where tourists never set foot.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="auto">&ldquo;If the way isn&rsquo;t too rough, I&rsquo;d like to visit myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="auto">&ldquo;All right. Let&rsquo;s go right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="auto">Mr. Willi accepted Author Jeong&rsquo;s suggestion at once, speaking as naturally as if he had planned it from the start. Mrs. Park switched off the small recorder and slipped it into her purple crossbody bag.</p>

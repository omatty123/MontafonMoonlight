<p>The ceiling of the Jeong's second-floor room featured a rectangular skylight. Moonlight streamed through, keeping the room from being dark. Due to its position, the moon itself wasn't visible. Mrs. Park soon began snoring softly. Author Jeong came out into the living room and took a notebook from his suitcase. While he could memorise the opening of the lecture, committing the entire content to memory felt burdensome. He reckoned he’d have to jot down the lecture content in his notebook and refer to it during the talk to avoid mistakes. He first organised the main body of the lecture in his mind. He then settled on ‘Why do Koreans like Buddhism?’ as the central theme. He’d previously published similar content in an essay and it was a topic he’d occasionally discussed over tea with acquaintances, so it posed no difficulty.</p>

<p>&lt;Buddhism is a religion that originated in India around the fifth century BC. Its founder was the Buddha and its doctrine is the truth the Buddha realised. Buddhism begins from the premise that life is marked by suffering through the course of birth, ageing, sickness, and death. To escape suffering, one must remove its causes by oneself. In Buddhism, this is the only way that salvation and happiness could be found. The Buddhist position is that I save myself; no god or other transcendent being saves me. Buddhism is not a theocentric religion but a humanistic one. It is a religion that seeks above all to uphold the value and dignity of human beings as they exist in reality. Thus, the Buddha rejected the caste system and taught that all human beings are equal.</p>

<p>Early Buddhism during the Buddha’s lifetime held that achieving one’s own happiness was the supreme goal. The aim of Mahayana Buddhism, which emerged after the Buddha passed away and entered parinirvana, was to seek the truth (上求菩提: seek enlightenment above) and then benefit all beings (下化衆生: transform sentient beings below). Mahayana Buddhism upholds as its ideal that both I and others attain happiness. Mahayana Buddhism does not pray for oneself; praying for others is true prayer. Its basis lies in the Buddha’s logic of interdependence: “Because this exists, that exists; because that ceases, this ceases.” Without me, not a single flower, cloud, or star would exist. Without the sun, wind, and rain, I too would disappear. In other words, the Buddha’s truth is that all beings in the world are branches, leaves, and flowers arising from a single root. Therefore, when others become happy, I too become happy; when others become unhappy, I too inevitably become unhappy.</p>

<p>There are two theories regarding the transmission of Buddhism to Korea. One holds that it was formally adopted through diplomatic channels from China in the second year of King Sosurim (372 AD) of the ancient northern kingdom of Goguryeo. The other holds that Queen Heo Hwang-ok of the southern Indian kingdom of Ayuta, having set out in search of a new land, brought Buddhism to the ancient southern Korean kingdom of Gaya in 48 AD. In any case, Buddhism has been in Korea for more than 1,600 years. Why did Buddhism spread so quickly through the royal court and wider society after its arrival? As a writer, this is how I see it.</p>

<p>First, Buddhism suited the Korean people, who cherished peace over conflict. Before Buddhism arrived, Korea had only modest forms of indigenous beliefs, Daoism, and Confucianism. That is, indigenous beliefs involving totem worship and belief in mountain spirits; Daoism centred on praying to the Big Dipper; and Ruism [commonly known as Confucianism] based on the teachings of Kongzi (Latinized: Confucius). Buddhism, however, did not conflict with these traditions, it embraced them all. Even today, when visiting Korean temples, one finds traces of Daoism in the Chilseonggak shrines to the Big Dipper and Sangingak shrines to mountain spirits, and many poems and writings left by Ruist scholars.</p>

<p>Buddhist compassion is the non-dualistic love of becoming one with others. It is never a dualistic love that distinguishes between self and others. The philosophical depth and greatness of Buddhism lie precisely in this non-dualism, as vast as the sky and as deep as the ocean. Integration and harmony, not separation and conflict, are Buddhism's defining characteristics.</p>

<p>Second, Buddhism was a good fit for the patient Korean people. Buddhism's concept of time is not limited to the present alone. It encompasses the past, present, and future. Thus, present life is merely a fleeting moment. This Buddhist view of time aligned well with the relaxed disposition of Koreans. When an adult passes away, Koreans do not say they "died" but rather that they "have returned." In other words, it expresses the idea that they have moved from this point today to some point tomorrow. Buddhist cosmology is also not limited to just our solar system. There are countless solar systems and heavens. It is said that the Buddha, living as the Bodhisattva Prabhapala (Kor: Homyeong) in one of these heavens, the Tushita Heaven, descended to the human world to become a teacher, helping humans realize "perfect happiness" by eliminating their own afflictions.</p>

<p>Because Koreans believe in both the past and the future, they have generally overcome hardships and adversities without succumbing to despair or discouragement. In a sense, they have developed a genetic code for an unyielding vitality. Buddhism emphasizes endurance and patience, while also teaching the importance of accumulating good deeds. These acts are, in essence, a form of savings laid aside for future happiness. In Buddhism, no one is exempt from the law of cause and effect. It applies equally to all; no one receives special privilege. If you sow good seeds, you will reap good fruit; if you sow evil seeds, you will reap evil fruit. There is a Korean proverb that expresses this perfectly: “Plant beans, and you get beans; plant red beans, and you get red beans.” This saying, too, has its roots in Buddhist teachings. And in the Buddhist <em>Lotus Sutra</em>, we find a similar lesson:</p>

<p>Do you want to know what happened in the past?</p>
<p>It is what you receive today.</p>
<p>Do you want to know what will happen in the future?</p>
<p>It is what you create today.</p>

<p>Third, a full 80% of Korea's cultural assets are a legacy of Buddhism. It is impossible to discuss Korean culture and thought without acknowledging the central role of Buddhism. The Korean government, which maintains a strict separation of religion and state, provides support for the preservation and management of Buddhist culture. This is done not to promote the religion of Buddhism itself, but to protect Korea's traditional culture and ideology. It is a matter of national policy to ensure that Korea does not lose its unique identity.</p>

<p>I have been sharing my thoughts on "What is Buddhism to Koreans?" as they come to me. Yet, even from this cursory overview, it is clear that Buddhism is more than just a religion to us; it has become part of the very lifeblood of the Korean people.</p>

<p>Present-day Korea is a multi-religious society. Calling it a "religious department store" would not be an exaggeration. Adherents of Christianity, Buddhism, Ruism, Daoism, Islam, and other faiths live their religious lives with vibrancy and freedom. The greatest aspiration of the Korean people is the reunification of the Korean peninsula. However, some scholars suggest that the most significant challenge after reunification could be conflict among religions. Yet, considering the inherent resilience of Koreans, I believe such a tragedy will not come to pass.</p>

<p>In the 2nd century BC, Emperor Ashoka of India converted to Buddhism, renounced the sword of conquest, and dispatched monks to spread the Dharma to regions including Rome, South India, Sri Lanka, and Southeast Asia. His dream was to achieve world peace through the truth of Buddhism. Ashoka enacted policies for the benefit of all living beings, not just humans. Among these was the construction of animal hospitals throughout India, a measure rooted in the conviction that animal life possesses the same dignity as human life. Though these events transpired in the 2nd century BC, I believe Ashoka's model of leadership is one we still require in the 21st century. To contemplate the dignity of all living beings in this world and to love them as part of one's own body is, I believe, our duty and our wisest course of action today.&gt;</p>

<p>Author Jeong was unable to finish his lecture notes and stepped into the room where Mrs. Park lay sleeping. A tide of weariness and exhaustion suddenly washed over him, and his shoulders grew heavy, as if made of stone. It seemed a lamp was lit in the room, or perhaps it was the moonlight, filtering through the skylight, filling the space with its gentle, rippling luminescence.</p>

<p>After their walk, the group decided to return to their respective lodgings to rest. This was so they could attend the traditional Montafon theatre performance in the early evening. Chairwoman Kwon mentioned that Mr. Willi had reserved the tickets. Author Jeong and his wife went straight to their guesthouse. Perhaps because she had become more familiar with them over the past two days, the guesthouse owner seemed less shy. She cautiously approached them first.</p>

<p>"How was lunch?"</p>

<p>Author Jeong answered honestly.</p>

<p>“It was so salty it was hard to eat. Next time we go to a restaurant, I’ll have to ask them not to add any salt. I’d rather season it myself.”</p>

<p>"What did you have?"</p>

<p>“My wife and I shared a plate of spaghetti vongole.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Italian food. Since Montafon is so close to Italy, people here often enjoy Italian dishes as well.”</p>

<p>When they returned to their room, Mr. and Mrs. Jeong each drank a glass of lemon tea from the table. Their throats felt dry, perhaps from the salty meal, though the taste of salt still seemed to linger. Mrs. Park said,</p>

<p>“I don’t think most people would understand what Mr. Willi says. Honestly, it doesn’t come naturally to me either, though today, I’m starting to catch more of it.”</p>

<p>“I completely empathize with him. It’s because I understand it from a Buddhist perspective. Mr. Willi’s way of thinking seems Eastern, he seems to prefer intuitive insight to rational thought. Europeans used to rationalism would probably find it hard to understand him.”</p>

<p>“Which part, specifically?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Willi’s childhood illness, for example. He was sick even in grade school, but the illness he suffered during adolescence is like a complex code. If that code could be deciphered, we might finally understand his life.”</p>

<p>“If it’s like a code, it’s like a <em>hwadu</em> a monk contemplates in the meditation hall.”</p>

<p>“Exactly. Mr. Willi held on to his illness, or rather, he became one with it and fought through it. In the end, it opened the door of life for him. It even feels like a kind of resurrection. Before leaving Montafon, I plan to ask him more about his incurable illness. There’s something I’ve been thinking about.”</p>

<p>“Won’t Mr. Willi dislike having to relive those painful memories?”</p>

<p>“Not at all. His music began because of his illness, so he’ll probably speak of it warmly and with gratitude. People here in Austria wouldn’t understand the idea of being happy because of illness. There’s a saying in the sutras: ‘Take the suffering of illness as good medicine.’ Do you think people here could understand that teaching of the Buddha?”</p>

<p>“I suppose not.”</p>

<p>“The Buddha teaches us to take illness and suffering as good medicine, to see them not as obstacles in life but as opportunities for growth and enlightenment. Mr. Willi is a composer who has lived that teaching. To me, he’s no different from an Eastern practitioner. Must one shave one’s head and leave home to be an ascetic?”</p>

<p>“You really are deeply interested in Mr. Willi’s illness.”</p>

<p>Author Jeong lay on the bed, resting with his limbs spread wide like the character ‘大’. Mrs. Park took notes in her notebook about Mr. Willi, whom she had met just moments earlier. It was her usual habit and role. When they returned to Korea, she always handed the journal of notes to Author Jeong. She would laugh and call herself his manager, the one who handled his schedule. To that, Author Jeong would joke, not “manager” but “<em>manhi jwo</em>,” Korean for “give me a lot.”</p>

<p>The Jeongs arrived at Mr. Willi’s house a little earlier than planned, because something they wanted to tell him had come to mind. This time, they met in the garden instead of going up to his second-floor living room. In the garden stood a large earthenware jar, several flower pots, and a round iron table. Plants like Chinese evergreens grew in the jars, and flowers bloomed red in the pots. Since it was early autumn, the lawn was still fresh and green. The Jeongs sat on white iron chairs. When Chairwoman Kwon joined them a moment later, Author Jeong couldn’t hold back and began to speak.</p>

<p>“It’s the story of your painful years in the hospital that you told me yesterday. It was so deeply moving that it hasn’t left my mind. It seems those five years in the hospital became the turning point of your life as a composer, fated, one might say. In the East, monks deliberately undergo ascetic practice to attain enlightenment. I’ve met several Korean practitioners who reached enlightenment through such austerity.”</p>

<p>“I’d also like to meet and speak with those Korean practitioners who practiced such austerity. If I ever have the chance to visit Korea again, I’d very much like to meet them.”</p>

<p>“I can introduce you to them. Some have passed away, while others are still living. For example, Venerable Seongcheol, Venerable Ilta, Venerable Hyeam, and Venerable Beopjeon have passed away, while Venerable Hyeguk and several others are still alive. Venerable Seongcheol practiced for eight years without ever lying down, even when he slept. Venerable Ilta burned four fingers of his right hand in a mountain hermitage. Venerable Hyeam never lay down, day or night, throughout his entire life as a monk. Venerable Beopjeon was so devoted to his practice in one hermitage that, in winter, he would cook enough rice for fifteen days at once, unwilling to waste time cooking, and would sometimes forget to eat. Among those still living, Venerable Hyeguk performed 100,000 prostrations over six months in the Dharma hall, then burned three fingers of his right hand. The heat was so intense that it harmed his liver. In a sense, it was a form of extreme self-mortification. Yet through such austerities, all of these practitioners attained enlightenment. They realized that they and the universe are one. When one becomes one with the universe, one naturally comes to know the truth it holds, just as you, Mr. Willi, hear the sounds of nature.”</p>

<p>"That sounds terribly mysterious."</p>

<p>“In my view, Mr. Willi has already had a truly mysterious experience.”</p>

<p>“You think I had such an experience?”</p>

<p>“Monks choose asceticism deliberately, but in Mr. Willi’s case, it became ascetic practice under circumstances beyond his will, neither self-chosen nor forced by others.”</p>

<p>“For me, it was more suffering than asceticism.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Willi, you once said the hospital felt like a monastery. That, too, left a deep impression on me.”</p>

<p>“Ha ha ha. Did I really say that the painful hospital felt like a monastery?”</p>

<p>Mr. Willi burst out laughing, seemingly amazed by Author Jeong’s ability to pick up and interpret the tiniest details in their conversation.</p>

<p>“When the doctors all delivered a terminal diagnosis and gave up on him, Mr. Willi, like a monk in a monastery receiving a revelation, heard a voice from heaven: ‘Herbert, you will be cured. You can live.’”</p>

<p>After leaving Innsbruck Hospital, Willi was moved to a Swiss general hospital at his parents’ decision, but even the renowned doctors there delivered a hopeless prognosis. Finally, the head of the department, a female doctor, called Willi’s father in Montafon to inform him of the results and explain her opinion. When Willi’s father arrived, he asked, “Would you like to come with me to see the doctor?” Willi agreed. In the doctor’s office, in the presence of Willi, his father, and the nurses, the female physician spoke very matter-of-factly as she gave her opinion.</p>

<p>“There is nothing more we can do. As doctors, our work here is finished. Whether Willi remains in the hospital or goes home is now his choice.”</p>

<p>For a moment, everyone in the doctor’s office fell silent. Willi felt only resentment toward her. To die in the hospital or to die at home, there was nothing to say. For several seconds, or perhaps several minutes, a heavy silence hung in the air. No one spoke. It was a moment of complete stillness. Willi’s father stood in shock, looking as if he might faint. They had come to the Swiss hospital with such hope, only to face this devastating prognosis. Then Willi heard a voice from heaven: “Herbert, you will be cured. You can live.” No one else heard it, only Willi himself.</p>

<p>“In any case, I believe the sound of raindrops falling amid his pain gave Mr. Willi a kind of musical awakening. If anyone were to write his life story, I think that perspective would be essential. And that voice he heard in the Swiss hospital, wasn’t it a moment much like the enlightenment Eastern ascetics reach after long austerities?”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t dare say they were the same. But what is certain is that after hearing that voice from heaven, I went to a monastery and did as the priest instructed, and from then on, my body slowly began to recover.”</p>

<p>Chairwoman Kwon gave Author Jeong a look. It was time to go for dinner. Afterward, they were scheduled to see Montafon’s traditional play. Thinking they could continue the conversation over the meal, Author Jeong quickly took the hint.</p>

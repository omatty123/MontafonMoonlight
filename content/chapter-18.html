<p>Author Jeong was thoroughly satisfied with his lecture at Vienna's Kardinal König Haus (KKH), having prepared meticulously. He spoke for one hour starting at 3pm, with Chairwoman Kwon providing simultaneous interpretation. Bolstered by the deep interest and enthusiastic response from the packed audience, Jeong delivered his entire prepared content without omission. A 30-minute question-and-answer session followed the lecture. Two individuals left a particularly strong impression. One was a broadcaster.</p>
<p>Austria had only one state-run broadcaster. Their female director, who attended the lecture, remarked, "Through this lecture, I learned that Mrs. Francesca was of Austrian origin," expressing gratitude for the valuable information.</p>
<p>Most of the audience also showed great interest in the fact that Mrs. Francesca* was Austrian. Two or three members of the audience asked questions about Mrs. Francesca, such as "What connection led her to meet Korea's first President, Syngman Rhee?" and "Did Koreans love Mrs. Francesca?" Perhaps being a fellow Austrian made them particularly curious. Witnessing this, I felt a strong sense of expectation that Mrs. Francesca would become a figure who would strengthen the friendship between Korea and Austria.</p>
<p>Another question concerned dialogue between Korea's different religious leaders and original sin in Christianity. In response, Author Jeong stated, "As seen in the examples of Cardinal Kim Suhwan and Venerable Beopjeong in Korea, religious leaders frequently engage in dialogue." He then succinctly replied, "If Christianity has original sin, Buddhism has no such concept. Instead, it holds that one reaps what one sows (<em>jajak jasu</em>, 自作自受), that cause must precede effect (<em>ingwa eungbo</em>, 因果應報), and that both good and evil deeds undergo their own cycle of rebirth ." This answer drew applause. Particularly noteworthy was a gentleman resembling a young Catholic monk who had flown in on his private plane from Innsbruck, the city where composer Herbert Willi attended theological seminary. He consoled Author Jeong, saying, "Though the lecture hall is small and the audience modest, consider that those representing Austria have come."</p>
<p>Jeong concluded his lecture by reiterating key points from his talk during the Q&A session before stepping down from the microphone.</p>
<p>"The opera <em>Madame Butterfly</em> introduced Japan to Europe through the appearance of a Japanese woman in a kimono. If I novelize the story of Mrs. Francesca and Austrian composer Herbert Willi composes an opera using it as a libretto, a beautiful and elegant Korean woman in hanbok will appear. I shall await that moment."</p>
<p>Once again, he received thunderous applause, but then Author Jeong suddenly proposed ending the Q&A session. Seeing his strained expression, Chairwoman Kwon hastily made closing remarks. Though the audience felt a pang of regret, they had to content themselves with admiring Mrs. Park's ceramic works displayed around the lecture hall. One woman had already arrived specifically to view the ceramics. She was the gentlewoman who had purchased one of Mrs. Park's pieces at the Ampark Gallery. Author Jeong had recognised her at a glance as someone with a particular fondness for Mrs. Park's work. Moving to the café on the second floor of the Kardinal König Haus, Author Jeong confessed to Chairwoman Kwon and Mrs. Park.</p>
<p>"Before the lecture began, I drank an espresso because I loved its rich aroma, but it seems to have irritated my stomach and startled me."</p>
<p>"Your face went pale during the Q&A session."</p>
<p>Chairwoman Kwon responded to Mrs. Park's concern.</p>
<p>"The espresso's aroma tempted the writer, I see. First-timers should dilute it with water."</p>
<p>"I didn't know that and drank it straight. I was fine during the lecture, but by the end of the Q&A, I was breaking out in a cold sweat."</p>
<p>"So that's why you said you'd wrap up the Q&A session quickly."</p>
<p>"Truth be told, I actually found the Q&A more enjoyable. But I felt I might collapse if I'd continued any longer…"</p>
<p>Mrs. Park inquired.</p>
<p>"Are you better now?"</p>
<p>"Resting has eased the cramping in my stomach."</p>
<p>"But I can't return to the accommodation to rest immediately, as I have a two-person exhibition with Sabine shortly."</p>
<p>"Don't worry. You're gradually improving."</p>
<p>Author Jeong drank warm water instead of tea. It was to soothe his stomach, startled by the strong espresso concentrate. The espresso's stimulation hadn't been fatal, it seemed, as Jeong's condition gradually recovered. Shortly afterward, he regained enough energy to attend the opening ceremony for the two-person exhibition with Mrs. Park and Sabine. Just then, a text arrived from a Korean Buddhist media outlet. It was reporter Lee Hakjong from <em>Media Buddha</em>. Jeong had mentioned the reason for traveling to Austria over the phone when leaving Korea, so the reporter must have been very curious.</p>
<p>It was just 30 minutes after Author Jeong sent his message. It was around 1 a.m. in Korea, past midnight, when reporter Lee Hakjong sent Author Jeong a text after drafting the article, saying, "I'm off to bed now."</p>
<p>Novelist Jeong Chanju (Dharma name: Muyeom) and ceramic artist Park Myeongsuk (Dharma name: Muryanggwang), who are actively engaged in creative work at Ibuljae above Ssangbong-sa temple in Hwasun, South Jeolla Province, embarked on a very special 18-day visit to Austria on September 10.</p>
<p>Their visit, which lasted until September 27, was by invitation from Vienna's KKH for Austrians and overseas Koreans. On September 20, novelist Jeong Chanju gave a special lecture and Q&A session titled "What is Buddhism to Koreans?" From September 14 to 18, Buddhist ceramic artist Park Myeongsuk held a Vienna invitational exhibition themed "The Beauty of Korea" at Galerie Ampark. Artist Park also held a two-person exhibition with Austrian ceramic artist Sabine at the Kardinal König Haus.</p>
<p>The two conveyed to <em>Media Buddha</em> that this 18-day visit to Austria was an immensely rewarding journey, conveying the very essence of Korean Buddhist culture, viewed through the dual prisms of "Korean Buddhist Literature" and "Traditional Korean Ceramics," directly to the heart of Austria, a Catholic nation where interest in Buddhism is growing.</p>
<p>Author Jeong intended to send more detailed information via text message, including that the trip to Austria was arranged at the invitation of IMK Chairwoman Kwon Suk-nyeo [Sonja Steindl-Kwon], but decided against it. Reporter Lee's draft article was sufficient. In any case, he planned to refine it further after arriving at work before publishing it in the <a href="http://www.mediabuddha.net/news/view.php?number=16311">People in the News</a> section of <em>Media Buddha</em> around the time the Jeong couple returned home.</p>
<p>One week later.</p>
<p>It was September 26. Author Jeong and Mrs. Park changed into hanbok once more. They were heading to Vienna's Musikverein Golden Hall, known to Austrian musicians as the Golden Hall. Every year, IMK held a charity concert event at the Golden Hall. This IMK charity event invited Austrian seniors, who seldom encountered classical music, to the concert. The seniors, invited from various Austrian provinces, experienced Korea's filial piety culture through the concert. Chairwoman Kwon, who planned and directed the filial piety concert, announced that the performers participating in this event were Chinese pianist Shiran Wang (王詩然) and a rising Korean violinist.</p>
<p>As the Jeong-Park couple entered the Golden Hall dressed in hanbok, the Austrian seniors welcomed them with thumbs up gestures. The elderly men and women were also smartly dressed, looking their best. Thanks to Chairwoman Kwon's consideration, the Jeong couple were seated in the middle of the main auditorium on the first floor, with a direct view of the stage.</p>
<p>Chairwoman Kwon sat immediately beside the stage where the musicians were seated before delivering the opening address for the filial piety concert. Though it was in German and thus incomprehensible, it was astonishing in itself that a petite Asian woman was delivering the address with a voice that resonated powerfully throughout the first floor and the upper tiers encircling it. It struck Author Jeong as particularly special and a source of pride that a successful expatriate was holding a charity concert for some 1,700 Austrian seniors in the Golden Hall, the most prestigious of all concert houses.</p>
<p>The two-hour concert ended all too soon. Frankly, though Author Jeong knew little about music, he found it not at all tedious, and seeing the happy expressions in the Austrian seniors' eyes alone was deeply moving. Moreover, after the concert, the Jeong couple were invited to the Golden Hall banquet. Their designated seats were practically VIP level. Seated beside them, Shiran Wang was performing on the piano, and from their vantage point, they could see every subtle expression on her face and the intricate movements of her fingers.</p>

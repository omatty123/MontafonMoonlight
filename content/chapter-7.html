  <p>Mr. Herbert Willi's home was situated slightly higher than the area with shops and hotels in the Montafon basin. As we climbed the uphill mountain road at the entrance to the Montafon Valley, Mr. Willi's home came into view. It was a two-story house with a small garden attached. The lodging for my wife and me was located further up the mountain road, across from and overlooking Mr. Willi's house. Both houses seemed to be at about 700 meters above sea level. Chairwoman Kwon said,</p>

  <p>“I deliberately arranged a guesthouse close to Mr. Willi’s home. It’s where you’ll stay for three nights and four days. Since only you and Mrs. Park will be there, it should be comfortable.”</p>

  <p>“So Mr. Willi arranged it in advance.”</p>

  <p>“That’s right. There are hotels, but he thought it would be better for you to stay nearby.”</p>

  <p>“I’m also glad to be staying near Mr. Willi’s house.”</p>

  <p>The group first got out in front of Mr. Willi’s house. Across the road, among the broad meadows on the distant hillside, stood houses with red roofs and white walls. Austrian rural and mountain homes were uniformly neat and modest, blending with the green fields like flocks of sheep. Perhaps because red and green are complementary colors, the meadows and houses stood out while still maintaining harmony.</p>

  <p>After receiving Chairwoman Kwon’s call, Mr. Willi came down the stairs from the second floor. For a Westerner, he was slender and short. He wore a gray jumper and jeans. Mr. Willi first approached Author Jeong and his wife, extending his hand, then lightly embraced Chairwoman Kwon and her husband. His first impression was gentle like a woman’s and pure like a boy’s. At the same time, his silver hair reflecting the sunset seemed like an aura of his spirit. Perhaps because of this, his whole presence gave the impression of transparent crystal. Chairwoman Kwon interpreted Mr. Willi’s words.</p>

  <p>"Author Jeong, Mr. Willi says he will host dinner tonight at a Thai restaurant. He asks that you first go to your lodgings, unpack, and wait there."</p>

  <p>"Please convey my thanks to Mr. Willi."</p>

  <p>Author Jeong once again said “Thank you” directly to Mr. Willi in Korean. Mr. Willi responded with a radiant smile and a Buddhist-style gesture of joined palms. As they walked up to the guesthouse above Mr. Willi’s home, Chairwoman Kwon said,</p>

  <p>“It seems he reserved the Thai restaurant out of consideration for you and your wife, Author Jeong.”</p>

  <p>“Thank you and by the way, Mr. Willi’s first impression is very appealing. I had imagined him like a charismatic conductor, but he is not. He is as clear as the stream flowing through the Montafon Valley, and unlike the Viennese, his appearance is very simple, fitting for this mountain village. Yet his presence is transparent like crystal and dazzling like his silver hair.”</p>

  <p>“As expected of an author, your expression is truly distinctive. Unlike the dashing Viennese gentlemen, Mr. Willi seems rather plain. But he is Montafon’s treasure. Even now, musicians in Austria, let alone Europe, hardly know him, because Mr. Willi has chosen to live in seclusion in Montafon.”</p>

  <p>“That’s similar to me living in Ibulae, deep in the mountains of South Jeolla Province in Korea. Hahaha.”</p>

  <p>“I see. You both are alike in being deep in the mountains. When I first visited Ibulae, my impression was that it, too, was a remote mountain setting like Montafon.”</p>

  <p>“That said, Mr. Willi may feel lonely, but he will not feel isolated, since he meets many people through his works.”</p>

  <p>Mrs. Park, who was beside him, said.</p>

  <p>"Artists seem to like solitude."</p>

  <p>“This is the first time I’ve told you this, Chairwoman Kwon, but most guests from Seoul who visit Ibuljae ask me the same thing. Seeing me live in the mountains, they ask whether I feel lonely, whether I feel solitude. I tell them that loneliness is the power that sustains life in the mountains. If there were no solitude here, what joy would there be? If solitude has a degree of purity, it must be absolute solitude. When I say that perhaps people in the city drink and go to karaoke bars because they fear loneliness, only then do they nod. I think that may be why Mr. Willi never leaves the Montafon Valley.”</p>

  <p>Mrs. Park seemed to understand, having once exchanged such words with Author Jeong at Ibuljae. But Chairwoman Kwon, not grasping it right away, asked again.</p>

  <p>“Is Mr. Willi’s reason for never leaving Montafon really absolute solitude?”</p>

  <p>“Mr. Willi once said that his music begins in the absolute stillness, the absolute silence of Montafon. Isn’t that absolute stillness nature itself, the ancient silence of the Montafon Alps? The primordial, absolute stillness of the beginning of time.”</p>

  <p>Indeed, the primeval forests on the slopes of Montafon or the glaciers at the Alpine summits must hold an absolute silence free of human noise. That same absolute silence, with identical purity and fullness, must surely exist now just as it did hundreds of millions of years ago. In an interview with a Korean music magazine, Mr. Willi said that in order to encounter such silence, he would walk for months through the Alpine peaks or along the slopes of Montafon.</p>

  <p>“I interpreted Mr. Willi’s words about absolute silence, but to be honest, I don’t fully understand what they mean.”</p>

  <p>“I too would like to visit a place where absolute silence exists, since that is said to be where Mr. Willi’s music begins.”</p>

  <p>“I’ll ask Mr. Willi. It would be wonderful if we could go as soon as tomorrow.”</p>

  <p>From the outside, the guesthouse looked smaller than Mr. Willi’s home. A hostess who appeared to be in her sixties greeted the group at the door. The room where Author Jeong and his wife would stay for three nights and four days was on the first floor near the dining room. The hostess probably moved upstairs out of consideration for her guests. Her expression was kindly, befitting a countrywoman of the Montafon Valley. In welcoming Author Jeong and his wife, she showed no airs of ownership; on the contrary, she seemed shy in front of them. As she moved about the living room speaking with Chairwoman Kwon, Author Jeong asked Chairwoman Kwon whether there was some problem with the guesthouse.</p>

  <p>"Was the reservation made incorrectly?"</p>

  <p>“Mr. Willi made the reservation, so that isn’t the issue. The hostess just seems very pure-hearted.”</p>

  <p>"Then why is the hostess so flustered?"</p>

  <p>“Yes, she seems worried about properly hosting Author Jeong and his wife from Korea. She says it’s a big problem because she doesn’t speak Korean—nor even English.”</p>

  <p>Author Jeong was instantly moved by the hostess’s attitude toward receiving guests. Perhaps it was out of carefulness at Mr. Willi’s request, but surely it sprang from her kind nature. Chairwoman Kwon spoke to Author Jeong as if asking for his understanding.</p>

  <p>“My wife and I can stay at Mr. Willi’s house. Whenever we came to Montafon, the first-floor room in his home was always mine. It was the room his parents had used when they were alive.”</p>

  <p>Before long, the hostess brought out precious black tea on the living room table. Usually, the villagers drank lemon tea among themselves. When Chairwoman Kwon tried to leave, she took her hand and urged her to stay for tea. Chairwoman Kwon and her husband, together with Author Jeong and his wife, sat on the gray sofa and drank the black tea. In the glass cups it glowed an unusually deep red, like the sunset in the western Montafon sky. Seeing the position of the sunset, Dr. Werner explained the surrounding terrain to Author Jeong.</p>

  <p>“The mountains facing north outside the window all rise above 2,000 meters; beyond them lies Germany. To the west, where the sunset glows, just over the mountains is Switzerland. The distant southern peaks visible from the doorway of this house also exceed 2,000 meters, and beyond them is Italy. So beyond the mountains surrounding Montafon lie Switzerland, Germany, and Italy. At the hotel restaurants here, Romani from Italy sometimes come in, sing with guitar accompaniment, and then walk around with hats for tips. They come because it is geographically close.”</p>

  <p>Author Jeong and his wife soon parted from Chairwoman Kwon and her husband. Outside the window, night had fallen suddenly. Lights flickered in the village opposite. It seemed as if the earthly lights would soon rise to become the moon and stars of the Montafon sky. The stars had not yet appeared. After washing their hands, Author Jeong and his wife waited for Mr. Willi and Chairwoman Kwon with her husband, preparing to go to the Thai restaurant to which Mr. Willi had invited them.</p>

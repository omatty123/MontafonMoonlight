<p>While staying in Tuscany, Willi suddenly felt an urge to go to Vienna. He neither knew the reason nor could he explain it. After being gripped by the feeling for several days, he finally boarded a train from Tuscany to Vienna. Unable to go without any purpose, he made a phone call and arranged to meet a member of the organizing staff of the cultural arts festival Wiener Festwochen at Café Sperl at 11 a.m.</p>

<p>However, that person did not keep the appointment. After waiting for about 30 minutes at the café, Willi called the office and was told, with apologies, that the meeting could not take place because of another urgent matter. Willi was not particularly disappointed, as it had been a hastily arranged appointment. The train back to Tuscany was at 5 p.m.</p>

<p>Willi left the café and walked through the streets of Vienna. In front of the State Opera, he stopped just as he was about to head toward Kärntner Straße, in the direction of St. Stephen’s Cathedral. A group of people was approaching the opera house, and among them Willi recognized Claudio Abbado, the opera house’s music director. When the group entered the building, Willi naturally followed. It was an occasion at which Abbado was announcing the first Vienna Modern Festival, to be held in the fall of 1988.</p>

<p>Abbado sat in the front row with a few others, while Willi blended into the group of reporters facing him. Having come this far, Willi wanted to meet Abbado and waited until the press conference ended. Abbado was a world-renowned conductor, born in Milan, Italy, in 1933. Willi approached him as soon as the press conference was over, but Abbado was surrounded by people, and he had to wait for quite some time. Willi even considered giving up and leaving, but he sat down on a chair in the hall and patiently waited until everyone had gone.</p>

<p>When only the two of them remained, Willi approached Abbado. An awkward silence lingered for a moment. Abbado spoke first.</p>

<p>"Do you work at the opera house?"</p>

<p>"I just happened to be here."</p>

<p>Willi did not say that he was a composer. He had not released many works, and his compositions were rarely performed, so he felt embarrassed to call himself a composer. Then Abbado spoke again.</p>

<p>"You seem to have come to see me. Tell me."</p>

<p>Willi explained why he had come to Vienna.</p>

<p>“I brought the score to show a member of the Wiener Festwochen staff, but he said he had another appointment, so I was unable to pass it on.”</p>

<p>"Really? Can you show it to me?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>Willi took the score out of his bag, handed it to Abbado, and said goodbye. He then caught the 5 p.m. train back to Tuscany.</p>

<p>A short time later.</p>

<p>Willi encountered another stroke of luck. He drove to Florence to watch the live broadcast of the football match between the Soviet and Italian teams. It was a semifinal match scheduled for the afternoon of June 22nd at the stadium in Stuttgart, Germany. Willi wanted to watch the semifinal, so he parked his car on the edge of Florence's old town and walked into the city center. He immediately entered a bar that was showing the match, but one of the patrons had brought a trumpet and started cheering for the Italian team, making it too noisy to watch calmly. Not only that, since Italy lost 0-2, Willi wasn't in the mood for drinking. He left the bar to return to his Tuscan villa.</p>

<p>And then, in front of the old Teatro Comunale, Willi spotted a large poster advertising a concert celebrating the 80th birthday of the veteran French composer Olivier Messiaen. Messiaen was someone Willi wanted to meet as much as Abbado. Moments later, something unbelievable happened. Messiaen was walking towards the theater. Willi hurried over and greeted him.</p>

<p>"My name is Herbert Willi and I study composition. I've been wanting to meet you."</p>

<p>Willi couldn't speak French well, so he couldn't have a long conversation. But he managed to say he wanted to show him his work.</p>

<p>"Would you please take a look at my work?"</p>

<p>Messiaen saw the earnest look on Willi's face and nodded. In any case, Willi had persuaded him.</p>

<p>The next day, Willi returned to Florence with his scores and recorded music, first meeting Messiaen's wife, Yvonne Loriod, at the Teatro Comunale. After she went to see Messiaen, she said,</p>

<p>"My husband is busy and only has five minutes. Please understand."</p>

<p>But after looking at Willi's scores, Messiaen showed no sign of getting up even after five minutes had passed. Two hours flew by. Willi was astonished by Messiaen's serious attitude. In particular, Messiaen scrutinized every single note of the piece Willi had composed for solo flute, then closed his eyes gently. It seemed he was appreciating the music in his head.</p>

<p>"I have a recording. I'll play it for you."</p>

<p>"That won't be necessary."</p>

<p>Messiaen declined because he felt that the source of Willi’s music was similar to his own. He thought it would be a waste of time to listen to the recording as well. As an ornithologist, he incorporated birdsong, that is, the sounds of nature, into his compositions. Like Willi, he combined natural sounds with a sense of color and was thus also known as a composer of color. On the spot, he asked Willi to compose an orchestral work. Afterward, they shared a warm and intimate conversation, during which he also pointed out the darker side of the music world and offered Willi advice.</p>

<p>Such was the kind of advice he gave: that the music world is riddled with factions, schools, and conspiracies; that there may be times when one’s music does not align with the prevailing trends; and that even then, one must not change one’s style to follow the times, but compose only what one hears from within. For Willi, this advice could not have been anything other than a confirmation and affirmation of his own musical world.</p>

<p>From then on, Messiaen and Willi bonded musically like a long-acquainted master and student. Messiaen connected Willi with Pierre Boulez and other French musicians, and the two exchanged letters.</p>

<p>That autumn.</p>

<p>Willi received a call from Abbado, asking to meet at the State Opera at 1:00 p.m. on December 2. Willi took an early-morning train up to Vienna; it was not long after the First Vienna Modern Festival had ended. Abbado had summoned Willi in order to commission a work to be performed at the next festival. Having reviewed, from time to time, the scores Willi had previously left with him, he felt sufficiently confident to proceed with the commission.</p>

<p>"Work out the concept by Christmas, and try to finish it by early in the new year."</p>

<p>"Thank you."</p>

Abbado had summoned Willi in order to commission a work to be performed at the next festival. Having reviewed, from time to time, the scores Willi had previously left with him, he felt sufficiently confident to proceed with the commission. As a result of these efforts, 1989 became a year of dramatic professional advancement and growing recognition for Willi as a composer. His works were performed or premiered by the Vienna Boys’ Choir, the ORF Symphony Orchestra of the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation, the Vienna Konzerthaus, and the Vienna Symphony Orchestra, among others. For Willi, 1989 was a happy year. It was also a major stroke of good fortune that he received the Austrian State Scholarship for Composers for the first time, allowing him to live without financial concern.</p>

<p>This good fortune could be said to have come from his encounters with Abbado and Messiaen. Of course, it would not have been possible had Willi not first reached out to them while staying in Tuscany. <em>To be continued</em></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>The distant Alpine peaks appeared green. It was clear the
    Montafon Valley was drawing near. Dr. Werner suggested taking a break at the
    rest stop. Deep shadows had already settled over the valley below. Yet the
    forests on the ridges, still fully bathed in the afternoon sun, remained
    bright. Dr. Werner and Chairman Kwon ordered espresso served in small cups,
    while Author Jeong and Mrs. Park ordered orange juice. Mrs. Park gazed at
    the red-roofed cottages near the rest stop and remarked,</span></p><br>
<p dir="ltr">“In Austria, the country houses are more beautiful than the city
  ones. The flowers on the verandas look straight out of a fairy tale.”</p><br>
<p dir="ltr">"The clear weather probably makes them look even more beautiful.
  The weather here rivals Korea's autumn days. It rained continuously just a few
  days ago. When the weather clears like this, Austrians say it's ‘a day when
  angels go on an outing.'"</p><br>
<p dir="ltr">Chairman Kwon, who had been in charge of flower arrangements at her
  church, said,</p>
<p dir="ltr">"In Austrian villages, they sometimes select and award prizes to
  people who beautify their homes with flowers. I suppose it’s because they have
  the leisure to do so. Austria is a country where rural villagers earn higher
  incomes than city office workers."</p><br>
<p dir="ltr">Author Jeong responded to Dr. Werner’s words.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“An ideal country is one where those who labor and sweat can live
  well. Sweat is sacred, after all. Thank you for driving; you’ve worked hard.”
</p><br>
<p dir="ltr">“Cheonmaneyo~" (Not at all.)</p><br>
<p dir="ltr">“Hahaha.”</p><br>
<p dir="ltr">Author Jeong laughed out loud at Dr. Werner’s “cheonmaneyo” because
  it sounded sounded like he was talking about the driving fee: “That'll be ten
  million won.” The sedan kept driving along the well-paved, zigzagging mountain
  road. Soon, Chairman Kwon spoke up, saying she still had something left to say
  about Willi.</p><br>
<p dir="ltr">"After visiting Haein-sa, we went to Ihwajang, where Mrs. Francesca
  Donner lived. She was from Inzendorf, near Vienna. Willi listened to the story
  of Mrs. Francesca’s life and was&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">captivated."</p><br>
<p dir="ltr">"What aspect of her did Willi find so captivating?"</p><br>
<p dir="ltr">"The caretaker of Ihwajang began with the story of Dr. Syngman
  Rhee’s first meeting with Mrs. Francesca."</p><br>
<p dir="ltr">Chairman Kwon remembered it precisely because she had interpreted
  for Mr. Willi. The time and place of Dr. Rhee and Francesca's first meeting
  was Geneva, Switzerland, in 1933. Dr. Lee was attending the League of Nations
  conference, appealing to representatives and journalists about the plight of
  Koreans suffering under Japanese oppression. He was pleading that "Korea must
  be granted independence for peace in the Far East to be maintained."
  Meanwhile, Francesca was traveling through Switzerland with her mother, having
  passed through Paris.</p><br>
<p dir="ltr">At that time, in the restaurant of a hotel on Lake Geneva, the
  mother and daughter were seated with Dr. Rhee, a 58-year-old independence
  activist from Korea, after the manager asked for their understanding. The
  restaurant was packed with guests that day. The next day, Francesca cut out an
  article from a newspaper interview with Dr. Rhee and gave it to him and this
  became the catalyst for their deepening connection. Francesca, then 33, held
  an international certification as an English interpreter and specialized in
  shorthand and typing. Hearing of Dr. Rhee’s difficult circumstances, she
  decided to volunteer her services pro bono. She resolved to type for him and
  serve as his secretary.</p><br>
<p dir="ltr">Eventually, feelings of love blossomed between them. Overcoming
  various obstacles and opposition, they held their wedding ceremony on October
  8, 1934, in a special room at the Montclair Hotel in New York. Francesca’s
  mother vehemently opposed the marriage. Moreover, the views of those around
  Dr. Rhee were not favorable either, since an independence activist had married
  a foreign woman. However, Mrs. Francesca’s fluent English and German skills
  provided immense help to Dr. Rhee during his life in exile.</p><br>
<p dir="ltr">Ten years after their marriage, Korea gained independence on August
  15, 1945. Dr. Rhee returned first on October 16 and stayed at Donamjang. It
  had been 33 years since he left his homeland. Following Dr. Rhee, Mrs.
  Francesca also returned to Korea.</p><br>
<p dir="ltr">From this point on, Mrs. Francesca resolved to live as a Korean.
  She wore hanbok and learned how to cook Korean food. The couple moved to
  Ihwajang in 1947, and when Dr. Rhee became president, they moved into
  Gyeongmudae. Then, when President Rhee resigned in April 1960 at the demand of
  the Korean people, they returned to Ihwajang. A month later, Dr. Rhee went
  into exile in Hawaii. In July 1965, his remains were returned to Korea,
  resting one last time at Ihwajang before being laid to rest in the National
  Cemetery. After Dr. Rhee went into exile in Hawaii, Mrs. Francesca returned to
  Austria, her homeland. Longing for hanbok and Korean food, she returned to
  Ihwajang on May 16, 1970, and lived with her adopted son Rhee In-su, Cho
  Hye-ja, and their family. She passed away on March 19, 1992, at the age of 92,
  wearing a blue hanbok.</p><br>
<p dir="ltr">Her final will had the following statements: “Please make sure to
  put in the dentures I used for 22 years. I must meet Dr. Rhee with my dentures
  in." "When I die, do not use flowers. Helping those in need is far better than
  wasting money on unnecessary things." "Place the Taegeukgi, the Bible, and the
  hymn book that Dr. Rhee used during his independence movement days into the
  coffin.” “On the coffin lid, write ‘National Reunification (南北統一)' in the
  calligraphy Dr. Rhee loved to use.”</p><br>
<p dir="ltr">"At that time, I told Mr. Willi that Mrs. Francesca must have
  returned to Korea because of the Korean sentiment of jeong (情)."</p><br>
<p dir="ltr">"What was Mr. Willi's reaction?"</p><br>
<p dir="ltr">He seemed to understand a bit. After Mr. Willi’s lecture at the
  Korea National University of Arts, during the open discussion, I said that his
  passion and love for music felt like the Korean concept of jeong. Mr. Willi
  then asked the students what jeong meant, and their consensus was something
  like “a gift of the heart, given and received.”</p><br>
<p dir="ltr">Chairman Kwon added.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It seemed that Mr. Willi was gradually coming to understand the
  Korean concept of jeong in his own way. He said it might be described with
  words like solidarity, compassion, love, affection, and empathy. And it seems
  he enjoyed visiting Haein-sa. On the day he was returning to Austria after his
  visit to Korea, he wanted to go to a temple again. So we went to the Yeongsan
  Hall at Bongeun-sa in Gangnam.”</p><br>
<p dir="ltr">“I think he was drawn to the Buddha’s image, as if it reflected the
  stillness within himself. And perhaps Mr. Willi, who dislikes noise, was
  attracted to the uniquely quiet atmosphere of a mountain temple.”</p><br>
<p dir="ltr">“I really don't know. Anyway, at the Yeongsanjeon in Bongeun-sa,
  Mr. Willi knelt before the Buddha statue and prayed for quite a while. He
  looked like a devout Buddhist.”</p><br>
<p dir="ltr">While conversing with Chairman Kwon, Author Jeong briefly indulged
  in a fanciful thought: perhaps Mr. Willi had been a monk practicing at a
  Korean temple in a past life. The way he had stood transfixed, staring at the
  murals in the main hall of Haein-sa as if hypnotized, and the way he prayed
  like a devout Buddhist at the Yeongsanjeon in Bongeun-sa, gave wings to this
  imagination. Moreover, Bongeun-sa was the temple Mr. Willi himself had wished
  to visit.&nbsp;</p><br>
<p dir="ltr">Perhaps it was because he was reluctant to part with something he
  had long yearned for.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In any case, on the way to Incheon Airport, Willi surprised
  Chairman Kwon once more. He had kept his eyes closed since leaving Bongeun-sa,
  but opened them as they crossed the Incheon Bridge over the sea. Chairman Kwon
  thought Willi had been sleeping from exhaustion, but that was not the case.
</p><br>
<p dir="ltr">“Sonya, I’ve fully conceived the third movement of the orchestral
  piece Jeong (정). I finished it all on the way to the airport. I also felt
  jeong (情) from Mrs. Francesca.”</p><br>
<p dir="ltr">Before they knew it, the car carrying the group was entering the
  Montafon Valley, surrounded by mountains. After passing through two long
  tunnels, villages and red-roofed houses came into view. The houses were
  clustered on in small basins on the mountain slopes about 600 meters above sea
  level. Dr. Werner cheerfully interjected, as if he had been waiting for
  Chairman Kwon to finish speaking.</p><br>
<p dir="ltr">“We’ll soon arrive at St. Anton, where Mr. Willi, the composer of
  Jeong (정), lives. We should hear more from Author Jeong about what jeong (情)
  means to Koreans.”</p><br>
<p dir="ltr">Dr. Werner, who had been silent throughout the drive, had clearly
  been listening to the group's conversation. He, too, loved Korea and cherished
  its people.</p><br>

  <p><p>The reason Chairwoman Kwon invited Author Jeong was rather peculiar. At least, that was how Author Jeong interpreted it. It was because Chairwoman Kwon wanted to introduce Austrian composer Herbert Willi, with whom she had a deep musical connection, to Author Jeong. But Author Jeong had no connection to Mr. Willi and couldn’t fathom why they had to meet. So, the idea of Author Jeong meeting Mr. Willi was entirely Chairwoman Kwon’s one-sided plan. "Even if I go to Austria, do I really have to meet Mr. Willi?" Author Jeong knew nothing about Mr. Willi’s life or music, and since he wasn’t well-versed in classical music, he hesitated even more. But Chairwoman Kwon was a highly focused businesswoman with exceptional resourcefulness. She pursued her goals with patience, tireless activity, and never once gave up. Her founding of IMK, a classical music production company, and its growth into Austria’s premier performance agency alone testified to her determination and passion.</p>

    <p>Chairwoman Kwon first visited Ibuljae, the mountain retreat where Author Jeong lived, in late February 2013. At winter’s end, several days of spring-like weather caused the buds of green, white, and red plum blossoms along Ibuljae’s yard to swell. In a few days, the frogs seemed likely to awaken from hibernation. When the plum blossoms began to bloom, the frogs would rouse from their winter sleep and answer with their croaking.</p>

    <p>It was rare for an Austrian expatriate to visit Ibuljae as a reader of Author Jeong’s work. A Korean-American from San Francisco had once visited after reading his novel <em>Dasan’s Love</em>, but such occurrences were far from common. More recently, Professor Matty Wegehaupt from Lawrence University in Wisconsin had proofread the English translation of <em>Gwangju Arirang</em>, a novel about the Gwangju Uprising, and visited Ibuljae twice, but his purpose was clearly different from Chairwoman Kwon’s.</p>

    <p>Professor Matty, a scholar of East Asian history, had been deeply moved by the May 1980 Gwangju Uprising and even lived in Gwangju for three years.</p>

    <p>Chairwoman Kwon stayed for three nights and four days at Ssangbong-sa Temple, a thousand-year-old monastery below Ibuljae. She slept at the temple at night and came up to Ibuljae during the day to chat.</p>

    <p>Gradually, Author Jeong and his wife, Mrs. Pak, came to understand her better. She explained that she was from Yecheon and belonged to the Andong Kwon clan. Her father had run a velvet fabric factory but went bankrupt, so due to the family’s financial hardship she graduated from the tuition-free National Medical Center Nursing School. Later, as part of the first group of nurses sent to Germany, she worked at a hospital with two others. One of them, unable to adjust to German food and weeping whenever she felt homesick, eventually returned to Korea. Unlike that nurse, she enjoyed German food immensely. After meeting her Austrian doctor husband, she laughed, saying that the moment she stepped off the plane at Vienna Airport, she felt as comfortable as if she had come home.</p>

    <p>Of all her stories, what struck Author Jeong most was what she said upon leaving Ibuljae: "I slept so peacefully at Ssangbong-sa. I had thought only churches suited me, but a temple felt like well-tailored clothing." At the time, Author Jeong had his own guess as to why she said this, perhaps her mother had attended temples or she had gone on outings to temples in her childhood. He understood her words as meaning she had rediscovered her identity at Ssangbong-sa and this was something he sometimes thought about afterward.</p>

    <p>In any case, she returned to Austria and, a few months later, phoned with news. She had told Herbert Willi about Author Jeong’s Buddhist-themed novels and meditative essays, and he had shown interest, asking if any had been translated into English. Perhaps, after finding Author Jeong’s work fascinating, she had mentioned it thinking that Mr. Willi, who liked Koreans, would also take an interest. She then encouraged Author Jeong to come to Austria anytime. Rather than curtly refusing, he answered that he would consider it: "I’m currently serializing the novel <em>The Moon Reflected in a Thousand Rivers</em> on the online platform Media Buddha, so I’d need to check my schedule." As he was immersed in the serialization, he could not give a definite answer.</p>

    <p><em>The Moon Reflected in a Thousand Rivers</em> was a distinctively historical novel. Set in the Joseon era, when Koreans used borrowed Chinese characters to express themselves, it portrayed how the virtuous King Sejong, wishing to create and promote an alphabet easier than Chinese characters for his people, secretly collaborated with the eminent monk Shinmi to devise Hangeul, concealing the project from the mainstream scholars who revered China. Therefore, without solid historical verification, the story would lose persuasiveness. For Author Jeong, <em>The Moon Reflected in a Thousand Rivers</em> was several times harder to write than his other novels, so deciding to travel abroad was not something he could take lightly.</p>

    <p>Although Author Jeong had not given a definite yes, it was clear that Chairwoman Kwon had misunderstood him as saying he would come to Austria when the opportunity arose. In Korea, saying "I’ll consider it" tends to imply postponement, but in Austria it seemed to be understood as "I will make an effort to do it." This was evident because a few months later Chairwoman Kwon again called Author Jeong from overseas. "When will you be coming?" "I’ll let you know once I finish the serial novel I’m working on now. Since I’ll also be writing a serial next year, I can’t give you a definite answer right away." "I told Mr. Willi about you, and he is very eager to meet you. He is such a remarkable person that, if an unfinished Mozart score were discovered, they would ask him to complete it."</p>

    <p>Chairwoman Kwon appeared to hold Mr. Willi in great respect, affection, and even love. Mozart was born in 1756 and Mr. Willi in 1956, meaning there was a two-hundred-year gap between them, yet Chairwoman Kwon even regarded Mr. Willi as Mozart’s reincarnation.</p>

    <p>Chairwoman Kwon’s third call came in January 2015, a year later. Author Jeong had just finished serializing <em>The Moon Reflected in a Thousand Rivers</em> and was about to begin another serial novel. Just then, the head of the Jeollanam-do Provincial Office’s Arts Bureau visited Ibuljae, saying it was under the instructions of the newly appointed governor, and proposed serializing Admiral Yi Sun-sin’s patriotic determination to save the nation and his steadfast loyalty on the provincial website. The governor was a politician who knew what work Author Jeong was preparing. He had visited Ibuljae when he was a National Assembly member. During their conversation, he had said, "They call Jeolla the 'Land of Righteousness,' but I can’t quite grasp that concept." Author Jeong replied, "There isn’t a single spot along Jeolla’s coast that isn’t imbued with Admiral Yi Sun-sin’s spirit," adding that he had done field research and studies on Yi Sun-sin for over ten years, and signed a copy of his novel <em>Dasan’s Love</em>. This further developed their relationship. Later, he visited Ibuljae again and said, "Perhaps because I’m a former journalist, I like writers whose sentences are precise," expressing once more his trust in Author Jeong.</p>

    <p>Chairwoman Kwon’s third call was quite provocative. She may have been somewhat disappointed that, despite calling twice internationally, Author Jeong’s replies were unsatisfactory. "I think it’s time to show you a red card. Mr. Willi says to bring you over even if he has to kidnap you. What should I do?"</p>

    <p>Chairwoman Kwon’s tone was half-demanding, half-pleading.</p>

    <p>Author Jeong felt it was now time to make a firm decision about going to Austria. Chairwoman Kwon’s mention of a "red card" brought the words “faith and loyalty” to mind and he felt a pang of conscience. Because no matter how important his serial novel was, he did not want to betray his integrity. Moreover, hearing that Willi, a man he had never met, had said to bring him over even by kidnapping, made him curious about what kind of person he was. His curiosity was piqued not because Willi was Austria’s top composer, but because, as a writer, he wondered what sort of conversation Willi wished to have.</p>

    <p>As if under a spell, Author Jeong found himself making a promise to Chairwoman Kwon. "Chairwoman Kwon, my wife and I will come this autumn."</p>

    <p>"I’ve already arranged accommodations in Vienna. All you have to do is come."</p>

    <p>But instead of feeling relieved, he became deeply burdened. His epic novel <em>Yi Sun-sin’s Seven Years</em>, which he had agreed to serialize for three years on the Jeollanam-do provincial website, had not even begun.</p>

    <p><em>To be continued</em></p>

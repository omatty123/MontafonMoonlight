<h2>Three Phonecalls</h2>
<p>The first call arrives before breakfast, from a number that still lives in your muscle memory. 
The kettle clicks off; you let it cool while the voice on the line warms old rooms. 
The second call rides the afternoon—airport PA systems, a crowd like weather. 
By the third, night has drawn the lines on the map darker than they should be.</p>
<p>Three versions of the same request: come back, keep going, or turn somewhere new. 
You stack the choices like postcards and realize they all show the same horizon. 
You don’t need to choose a city. You need to choose a sentence. You begin with “I’m listening.”</p>

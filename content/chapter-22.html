<p>May 8, 2018.</p>

<p>Raindrops brushed against the airplane window. Rome seemed drenched in rain. In the distance, I could see the terminal of Rome’s Fiumicino Airport. Officially known as the Leonardo da Vinci Airport, I envied the Romans for giving their airports historical names. Venice had its own Marco Polo Airpor</p>

<p>As the plane landed at the terminal, the tightly shut doors opened. Only then did it feel real that they had arrived in Rome. For Jeong and his wife, the four nights and five days of their month-long European tour in Rome finally felt like they were beginning. Author Jeong was thrilled by the prospect of seeing the Colosseum, a culmination of Rome’s history and culture; the Catacombs, an underground burial complex, and the Basilica di St. Paul, which would prompt them to reflect on the meaning of faith; the Goethe Museum, where Goethe is said to have stayed; and the Vatican Museum, where they could compare and appreciate the sacred paintings of da Vinci and Raphael.</p>

<p>The immigration hall was bustling. Hundreds of people were waiting in line. Perhaps because it was past the 5 p.m. workday, most counters had “NO BUSINESS” signs posted. Only four or five counters were open. The line of tourists showed no signs of slowing down. The immigration officer, whether he knew it or not, remained unhurried and indifferent, despite the fact that 50,000 people once entered the Colosseum within 30 minutes. While chatting with his colleagues, he stamped the passport of author Jeong with a loud bang.</p>

<p>At the baggage claim, bags and luggage were already out, waiting for their owners. Unfortunately, Author Jeong’s suitcase was missing a wheel. He had no idea how to complain to the airline, and it was already nearing 9 p.m. As he dragged his wobbly suitcase to the taxi stand, rain poured down in sheets. The taxi stand, too, had a long line of passengers. The harsh rain quietly dampened the spirits of Author Jeong, who had come dreaming of a trip to Rome. Still, Author Jeong hoisted his now crippled suitcase into the taxi trunk and shouted,</p>

<p>“Del Corso Hotel!”</p>

<p>Although they had booked a hotel in central Rome online, a lingering unease crept over them. The taxi picked up Jeong and his wife almost as if it were abducting them, then tore through the rain. The downpour was so heavy the wipers could barely keep up, and the taxi even had to stop mid ride. What made Author Jeong still more uneasy was the driver. He kept searching the destination on his phone more than ten times, repeatedly turning left and right.</p>

<p>Only after they reached the hotel did Author Jeong regain his composure. The lodging they had reserved was not in the building with the front desk but in a separate wing. Perhaps because an old building had been renovated, the heavy doors let out a racket every time they opened. Their room was 503 on the first floor. It was odd to run into that familiar yet uncomfortable number. 503 was the inmate number of a former Korean president.</p>

<p>“The room number just happens to be the former president’s inmate number.”</p>

<p>“Oh my, how can that be!”</p>

<p>Sitting on the sofa, Author Jeong pulled the travel guidebook Italy, which he had bought at the Incheon Airport bookstore, from his backpack and opened it to the Rome section. He was trying to decide where to go the next day. Like Mrs. Park, he found himself drawn toward the Colosseum, the amphitheater that lets you take in Rome’s history and culture at a glance. He had often heard that a trip to Rome starts with the Colosseum.</p>

<p>The next morning.</p>

<p>Had Goethe said that the Roman sun makes even the dust shine? Rome looked completely different from yesterday. Even in the early morning, tourists were already strolling about in small groups. When they asked the front desk, a taxi arrived at once. The driver, too, was nothing like yesterday: he drove mostly straight, pointed toward the Colosseum with his finger, and kindly told them to pay whatever the meter showed.</p>

<p>Author Jeong and his wife read the introduction first. The Colosseum, built on the site where Emperor Nero had planned an artificial lake, was begun by Emperor Vespasian in AD 72 and completed during the reign of his son, Emperor Titus. It was truly remarkable. The oval open air arena measures 187 meters along its long axis, 155 meters along its short axis, and stands 48 meters tall.</p>

<p>“Honey, the explanation of the column styles is interesting.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we saw it in Athens, Greece.”</p>

<p>The phrase in the guide caught their eye: “The stone columns are in the Greek style, Doric on the first floor, Ionic on the second, and the most ornate Corinthian on the third.” Knowing the column styles made them even more eager. Author Jeong and his wife had gone on a study trip to Greece three years earlier and had come back with a firm grasp of the orders. They also noticed the note that the interior seating was tiered and could hold 50,000, and up to 80,000, spectators, and that there were 75 entrances so visitors could enter and leave quickly. The fact that the entrances were marked on tickets made of wooden tablets and clay struck them as something worth learning from even today.</p>

<p>The Colosseum was supposedly built so that emperors could soothe the Romans’ political and economic discontent by offering free spectacles, plays, circuses, and the horrific combat of gladiators. But was that really so? A politics of stupefying the people, of numbing reason, seemed to have continued even into the modern age of imperialism. Had he seen it in the film Gladiator? The image came to mind of foolish crowds roaring with delight at the brutal sight of gladiators fighting for their lives. Seeing the place with his own eyes, he felt as though every line in the guidebook must be true. The Colosseum was a colossal amphitheater, too vast to capture in a single shot. He climbed the hill facing its front and tried to press the shutter, but it was no use. He found himself recalling the poem of praise that the satirical poet Martial wrote after attending the Colosseum’s dedication ceremony.</p>

<p>O Egyptians, do not boast of the pyramids.</p>
<p>O Assyrians, do not let Babylon pass your lips.</p>
<p>Before the Emperor's new amphitheater,</p>
<p>there is no place for them to stand.
<p>All fame is for this alone—</p>
<p>All shall be overshadowed by it.</p>

<p>It did not sound merely like a piece of flattery that Martial offered to Emperor Titus. Faced with an amphitheater of such colossal scale, any poet would have been unable to hold back his admiration, and Author Jeong felt the same. More astonishing still was the claim that they supplied water and filled the arena, then staged mock naval battles. Since Rome was stronger on land than at sea, perhaps those sham sea battles featured charges and close quarters combat. And Author Jeong was speechless as he read the notice explaining that the first tier, with the best view, was reserved for nobles, the second for Roman citizens, and the third for those admitted free, that is, slaves, women, and foreigners without citizenship, and that there was even a massive awning to block the sun. Titus, it said, had dismantled the tyrant Nero’s “Golden Palace” and used its materials, and had financed the Colosseum with treasures plundered from Jerusalem, winning the Roman people’s wholehearted support, a ruler who seemed to possess exceptional political instincts.</p>

<p>After lunch, Author Jeong and his wife decided to head to Piazza Venezia, where the dictator Mussolini had declared Italy’s entry into World War I. They said there was a building modeled on the Doge’s Palace, once the residence of the Venetian Republic’s doge. But what Author Jeong most wanted to see was the area around the Piazza del Campidoglio, above the monument to Vittorio Emanuele II, the first king of a unified Italy. Most of Rome’s major sites were within a thirty minute walk, so there was no need for a taxi or tram. The sidewalk up the sloping road to the right of the Vittorio Emanuele II monument led to the Piazza del Campidoglio. Yet the monument itself, a white building, drew constant complaints from Romans for clashing with the surrounding time worn ruins, and Author Jeong agreed it looked out of place. Beside it, too, a five story apartment building from the Roman period lay below the present ground level, as if an earthquake had made it sink straight down. The staircase up to the square, however, was striking. Designed, they said, by Michelangelo, it lengthened the upper flight so that the square would appear closer, taking optical illusion into account. Because perspective makes the upper steps look smaller than the lower ones and thus feel psychologically farther away, he had designed the stairs by reversing that effect, prompting an involuntary thought: “A genius really is different.” The Capitoline Museums were easy to find, right next to the Piazza del Campidoglio. After using the restroom at the museum, the couple went straight down behind the building, hoping to see the Roman Forum for free.</p>

<p>Foro meant a public square, and it seemed likely to be the origin of the English word “forum.” In ancient Rome, the Forum Romanum had been the center of civic life, but it was said to have declined after political activity shifted to the emperor’s palace. Buildings stood along a cut hillside, and it looked as though medieval structures had been added onto ancient ones. A distinctive feature was that the windows grew progressively larger as the periods advanced. Across from that building stood the Arch of Septimius Severus, who became emperor in AD 193 after being acclaimed by his soldiers. A triumphal arch was a monument that Roman citizens and senators erected when a general returned from war victorious. Seeing the ruins of the Temple of Caesar brought to mind the full text of the letter Caesar sent to the Roman Senate in 47 BC after defeating King Pharnaces of Pontus.</p>

<p>‘I came. I saw. I conquered.’</p>

<p>Perhaps those three phrases suddenly came to mind because they seemed to speak for Author Jeong’s feelings after making his way to Rome through truly bitter and exhausting days. Thus the second day of Author Jeong and his wife’s four night, five day stay in Rome came to an end. To be continued.</p>

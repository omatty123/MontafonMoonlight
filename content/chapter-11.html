<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mr. Willi drove his sedan with the group aboard. After about ten minutes down the asphalt-paved mountain road, a stream flowing out of the Montafon Valley came into view. The stream moved swiftly enough to murmur over stones, its water a clear jade hue. After parking the car in the village lot and crossing the bridge, they found themselves on a narrow footpath. On the opposite hillside, sheep grazed peacefully. Mrs. Park, fascinated by the gray, woolly creatures, took photos with her phone. Chairman Kwon walked half a step behind Mr. Willi and Author Jeong to interpret. Soon, Billy began to speak.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Montafon is the cradle of my music. My representative work is the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Montafon Series, </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">a set of concertos for orchestra and four instruments: the first for trumpet, the second for flute and oboe, the third for clarinet, and the fourth for horn."</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Judging by your having composed the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Montafon Series</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it seems you, Mr. Willi, are the person among the people of Montafon who has received its blessings most fully, perhaps also the one most deeply loved by Montafon itself.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;You could say that, since I&rsquo;m so closely bound to the nature of Montafon. Montafon is the beginning and the end of my music. It&rsquo;s also why I can&rsquo;t live in cities like Salzburg or Vienna. It would be like a fish trying to live without water.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;What is the theme of the concerto for trumpet?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about people who travel to a place where music still lives, stay there for a time, and then return to where they began. The title is </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ger&auml;um Zeit</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, meaning &lsquo;limited space and time.&rsquo; There&rsquo;s a story behind that name. In our village lived a doctor whose wife loved my music dearly. One day, he called to tell me his wife had only a few days left, and asked if I could come to their home. I sensed immediately what he meant. I myself had once suffered from an incurable illness and come close to death before recovering. Because of that experience, I understood at once that the doctor&rsquo;s wife, too, was within a finite space and time, a realm neither here, in life, nor there, in death.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;So you titled it </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ger&auml;um Zeit</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because it refers to the space and time one dwells in just before death?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;In Buddhism, they say that after death, a person spends forty-nine days before taking on their next life. That interval is called the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">jungeum</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a kind of waystation where one waits for rebirth. Is it right to understand </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ger&auml;um Zeit </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">in that way?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good interpretation. In Catholicism, they say there&rsquo;s purgatory between heaven and hell. Purgatory is a space where souls are purified before entering heaven. It&rsquo;s a space and time akin to a waiting room before moving on, so it does bring to mind Buddhism&rsquo;s </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">jungeum</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">."</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Author Jeong wondered on which mountainside the music of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ger&auml;um Zeit </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">might have lived.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Where does the music of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ger&auml;um Zeit </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">dwell? Does it still live there now?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Tourists rarely go that far, so it&rsquo;s probably still living there. I know exactly, with certainty, where that music resides. It's on Piz Buin, the highest peak in the mountains of Vorarlberg, Austria, rising 3,312 meters above sea level. This is one of the Alpine peaks along the border between Austria and Switzerland. I used to visit the summit often. It was a sheer ice wall, reachable only by crossing a glacier. Even in midsummer, the ice stayed frozen. At the summit, there was nothing to see but snow and ice, so it felt like standing atop an iceberg. After crossing several ridges, I finally reached the summit and saw, for the first time in my life, a vast ice wall. But it no longer looks as it did then, because the snow and ice are melting. It troubles me deeply. The ice wall was impossibly pure, but its center glowed a deep indigo blue. When snow fell or the wind howled, it vanished from sight, yet when visible, its form was sharply defined. In that moment, a trumpet&rsquo;s sound rose from somewhere above me, then faded away. The middle of the ice wall looked like a window, and beyond it was an immense cliff. That&rsquo;s where the music lived, music dwelling in serene, absolute silence, which I encountered there.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Author Jeong fully empathized with the story Mr. Willi told. At first, he tried to understand it through a Buddhist framework, seeking intellectual agreement, but now his words seemed to seep not into his mind, but into his heart, naturally and without effort.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The first sound of the music that lived within the ice wall was the most delicate sound human ears could perceive. For example, when water freezes, it becomes solid ice; when it boils, it becomes steam. As the vapor rises, it grows as clear as air, and yet all of it is one and the same. I believe that music, when it becomes as pure as vapor, reaches its highest state. Music exists only at that summit, there is no lower or middle form of it.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mr. Willi suddenly stopped speaking. Then he looked at Author Jeong and Mrs. Park and smiled with childlike innocence, as if gauging their reactions to his monologue. Author Jeong asked Chairman Kwon to tell him they were listening with genuine interest and seriousness, and that he should please continue. As they climbed further along the mountain path, a wide meadow opened before them. On one side, cows grazed leisurely, brass bells the size of fists hanging from their necks. Mr. Willi began to speak again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Among all instruments, the clarinet is a special one for me, because my whole family was involved when I learned it. I began playing at around four or five years old, and both my parents were deeply interested. Back then, in Montafon, there were only a handful of houses, no school, and of course no music school. So I went to the home of an old man in the village to learn how to play, but he was a strict teacher. If I missed even a single note, he&rsquo;d pull my ear and make me stand on a chair or desk with my hands raised. I hated going there, so I told my father I didn&rsquo;t want to play the clarinet anymore. The old man must have learned that way himself. When I said I didn&rsquo;t want to go back, my father agreed and said he would teach me himself. If he hadn&rsquo;t, I might have ended my path in music right there. My father was a carpenter, but he could play all sorts of instruments, clarinet, piano, violin, flute, accordion, and more. He even composed music. Anyway, for several years, he personally taught me how to play the clarinet.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;So you inherited your musicality from your father, then?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Yes. My father&rsquo;s side was highly artistic. He was skillful, versatile, and gifted with his hands. He was also an excellent skier. Before I even started school, he used to take me up to the peak of that mountain over there and teach me to ski on the way down. If I hadn&rsquo;t fallen ill, I might have become a ski racer. My mother&rsquo;s side, by contrast, had depth of spirit. Many religious figures came from that family, and there was even a composer who lived around Schubert&rsquo;s time. They say some of his sheet music was found in a relative&rsquo;s attic about twenty years ago. Though my mother never played an instrument, she came to every premiere of my work, listened attentively, and always had something to say. &lsquo;This piece will be loved by musicians right away,&rsquo; or, &lsquo;This one will need ten years before people understand it,&rsquo; she&rsquo;d say, and she was always right. Isn&rsquo;t that remarkable?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;So both your father&rsquo;s and mother&rsquo;s sides were musically gifted, then.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mr. Willi, walking ahead, stopped. The mountain path had narrowed, the slope steepened, and the air felt thinner. As Author Jeong looked up toward the summit, wondering, 'Do we have to climb higher?,' Mr. Willi turned with a solemn expression and spoke.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re at 1,600 meters above sea level. From here on, this is where the music lives.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;So this is the place where you capture the sounds you hear with colored pencils. Ah, so this is what you brought me all the way here to see.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Today, I brought you here so you could see for yourself the place where the music I spoke of lives.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;What kind of instrument&rsquo;s sound lives here?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Depending on the place, the music of every instrument lives independently. In an orchestra, the accordionist usually sits somewhere in the middle, but here, each exists alone, like a soloist standing before the orchestra. Just as trees, humans, and mice are all equal parts of nature, so too are all instruments&rsquo; voices equal. I&rsquo;m sketching all of this music within nature, but there are still many parts I haven&rsquo;t yet brought to life. That&rsquo;s why my work never ends. I simply continue it while living here in Montafon. That&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t leave Montafon, or rather, why I can&rsquo;t leave.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We returned the way we came, heading downhill to a log cabin rest area on the side of the mountain path. Since it was past lunchtime, we decided to take a break. Mr. Willi and Chairman Kwon ordered bread and salad, while Author Jeong and Mrs. Park ordered spaghetti vongole. The Korean version of Spaghetti vongole would be like hand-made noodles with clams.</span></p>

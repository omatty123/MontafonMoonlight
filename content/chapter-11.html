<p>Mr. Willi drove his sedan with the group aboard. After about ten minutes down the asphalt-paved mountain road, a stream flowing out of the Montafon Valley came into view. The stream moved swiftly enough to murmur over stones, its water a clear jade hue. After parking the car in the village lot and crossing the bridge, they found themselves on a narrow footpath. On the opposite hillside, sheep grazed peacefully. Mrs. Park, fascinated by these gray, woolly balls of fur, took photos with her phone. Chairwoman Kwon walked half a step behind Mr. Willi and Author Jeong to interpret. Soon, Mr. Willi began to speak.</p>

<p>"Montafon is the cradle of my music. My representative work is the <em>Montafon Series</em>, a set of concertos for orchestra and four instruments: the first for trumpet, the second for flute and oboe, the third for clarinet, and the fourth for horn."</p>

<p>“Judging by your having composed the <em>Montafon Series</em>, it seems, Mr. Willi, that among the people of Montafon you are the person who has received its blessings most fully, perhaps also the one most deeply loved by Montafon itself.”</p>

<p>“In the fact that I’m so closely bound to the nature of Montafon, yes, you could say that. Montafon is the beginning and the end of my music. It’s also why I can’t live in cities like Salzburg or Vienna. It would be like a fish trying to live without water.”</p>

<p>“What is the theme of the trumpet concerto?”</p>

<p>“It’s about many people who travel to a place where music still lives, stay there for a time, and then return to where they began. The title is <em>Geräum Zeit</em>, meaning ‘limited space and time.’ There’s a story behind that name. In our village lived a doctor whose wife loved my music dearly. One day, he called to say his wife had only a few days left to live, and asked if I could pay a visit. I sensed immediately what he meant. I myself had once suffered from an incurable illness and come close to death before recovering. Because of that, I understood at once that the doctor’s wife, too, was within a finite space and time, a realm neither here, in life, nor there, in death.”</p>

<p>“So you titled it <em>Geräum Zeit</em> in reference to the space and time one dwells in just before death?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s right.”</p>

<p>“In Buddhism, they say that after death, a person spends forty-nine days before taking on their next life. That interval is called the <em>jungeum</em>, a kind of waystation where one waits for rebirth. Is it right to understand <em>Geräum Zeit</em> in that way?”</p>

<p>“That’s a good interpretation. In Catholicism, they say there’s purgatory between heaven and hell. Purgatory is a space where souls are purified before entering heaven. Since it is indeed a space and time akin to a waiting room before moving on, it definitely brings to mind Buddhism’s <em>jungeum</em>.”</p>

<p>Author Jeong wondered on which mountainside the music of <em>Geräum Zeit</em> might have lived.</p>

<p>“Where does the music of <em>Geräum Zeit</em> dwell? Does it still live there now?”</p>

<p>“Tourists rarely go that far, so it’s probably still living there. I know with certainty exactly where that music resides. It's on Piz Buin, the highest peak in the mountains of Vorarlberg, Austria, rising 3,312 meters above sea level. It is one of the Alpine peaks along the border between Austria and Switzerland. I used to visit the summit often. It was a sheer ice wall, reachable only by crossing a glacier. Even in midsummer, the ice stayed frozen. At the summit, there was nothing to see but snow and ice, so it felt like standing atop an iceberg. After crossing several ridges, I finally reached the summit and saw, for the first time in my life, a vast ice wall. But it no longer looks as it did then, because the snow and ice are melting. It troubles me deeply. The ice wall was impossibly pure and its center glowed a deep indigo blue. When snow fell or the wind howled, it vanished from sight, yet when visible, its form was sharply defined. In that moment, a trumpet’s sound rose from somewhere above me, then faded away. The middle of the ice wall looked like a window, and beyond it was an immense cliff. That’s where the music lived, music dwelling in the serene, absolute silence that I encountered there.”</p>

<p>Author Jeong fully empathized with the story Mr. Willi was telling. At first, he tried to understand it through a Buddhist framework, seeking intellectual agreement, but now his words seemed to be seeping into his heart rather than his head, naturally and without effort.</p>

<p>“The first sound of music that resided in the ice wall was a note that we humans could hear with our ears, one that we could perceive as the most delicate. For example, when water freezes, it becomes hard ice, but when it is boiled, it becomes vapor. As the vapor rises, it becomes as clear as air. However, all of these are one and the same. I believe that music, having become as pure as vapor, is the supreme state. Music is the supreme state itself; there is no bottom or middle."</p>

<p>Mr. Willi suddenly stopped speaking. He looked at Author Jeong and Mrs. Park and smiled with childlike innocence, as if gauging their reactions to his monologue. Author Jeong asked Chairwoman Kwon to let Mr. Willi know that they were listening with genuine interest and seriousness, and that he should please continue. As they climbed further along the mountain path, a wide meadow opened before them. On one side, cows grazed leisurely, brass bells the size of fists hanging from their necks. Mr. Willi began to speak again.</p>

<p>“Among all instruments, the clarinet is a special one for me, because my whole family was involved when I learned it. I started playing at around four or five years old, and both my parents were deeply interested. Back then in Montafon, there were only a handful of houses, no school, and of course no music school. So I went to the home of an old man in the village to learn how to play, but he was a strict teacher. If I missed even a single note, he’d pull my ear and make me stand on a chair or desk with my hands raised. I hated going there, so I told my father I didn’t want to play the clarinet anymore. The old man must have learned that way himself. When I said I didn’t want to go back, my father agreed and said he would teach me himself. If he hadn’t, I might have ended my journey in music right there. My father was a carpenter, but he could play all sorts of instruments, clarinet, piano, violin, flute, accordion, and more. He even composed music. Anyway, for several years, he personally taught me how to play the clarinet.”</p>

<p>“So you inherited your musicality from your father, then?”</p>

<p>“Yes. My father’s side was highly artistic. He was skillful, versatile, and gifted with his hands. He was also an excellent skier. Before I even started school, he used to take me up to the peak of that mountain over there and teach me to ski on the way down. If I hadn’t fallen ill, I might have become a ski racer. My mother’s side, by contrast, had depth of spirit. Many religious figures came from that family, and there was even a composer who lived around Schubert’s time. They say some of his sheet music was found in a relative’s attic about twenty years ago. Though my mother never played an instrument, she came to every premiere of my work, listened attentively, and always had something to say. ‘This piece will be loved by musicians right away,’ or, ‘This one will need ten years before people understand it,’ she’d say, and she was always right. Isn’t that amazing?”</p>

<p>“So both your father’s and mother’s sides were musically gifted, then.”</p>

<p>Mr. Willi, walking ahead, stopped. The mountain path had narrowed, the slope steepened, and the air felt thinner. As Author Jeong looked up toward the summit, wondering, “Do we have to climb higher?”, Mr. Willi turned with a solemn expression and spoke.</p>

<p>“We’re at 1,600 meters above sea level. From here on is where the music lives.”</p>

<p>“This is where you capture the sounds you hear with colored pencils. Aha, it is this place that you brought me all the way here to see.”</p>

<p>“That’s right. Today, I brought you here so you could see for yourself the place where the music I spoke of lives.”</p>

<p>“Thank you very much.”</p>

<p>“Which instrument’s sound lives here?”</p>

<p>“Depending on the place, the music of every instrument lives independently. In an orchestra, the accordionist usually sits somewhere in the middle, but here, each exists alone, like a soloist standing before the orchestra. Just as trees, humans, and mice are all equal parts of nature, so too is the voice of every instrument equal. I’m sketching all of this music within nature, but there are still many parts I haven’t yet brought to life. That’s why my work never ends. I simply continue it while living here in Montafon. That’s why I don’t leave Montafon, or rather, why I can’t leave.”</p>

<p>We returned the way we came, heading downhill to a log cabin rest area on the side of the mountain path. Since it was past lunchtime, we decided to take a break. Mr. Willi and Chairwoman Kwon ordered bread and salad, while Author Jeong and Mrs. Park ordered spaghetti alle vongole, the Korean version of which would be like hand-made noodles with clams.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">Dr. Werner, who was driving, was the tallest of the group. At about 180 centimeters, he was a head taller than the others, who were around 160 centimeters. Chairman Kwon sat in the front passenger seat, while Writer Jeong and his wife, Mrs. Park, sat in the back. Since Dr. Werner had a long torso, the crown of his head nearly touched the roof of the car.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">As the car left the outskirts of Vienna and drove toward the city of Krems, the Danube River appeared. The river was not especially wide, but its waters were abundant and seemed deep. The Danube&rsquo;s expression differed from afar and up close. From a distance it looked pastoral and peaceful, but through the car window as it sped along the bank, the water licked at the grasses and flowed eastward with force. Further west, toward Innsbruck, the upper valley waters grew shallower and sparkled a jade hue. Staring at the distant mountains, Chairman Kwon let the breeze from the half-open window wash over him and began to talk about Mr. Willi.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">&ldquo;Writer Jeong, Innsbruck is not far now. Mr. Willi was born in the state of Vorarlberg, in the village of St. Anton in the Montafon Valley. His father was a carpenter who could also play the piano and violin. Willi&rsquo;s grandfather was a carpenter as well. By making furniture such as wardrobes, his father supported the family, but to Willi, he also served as a music tutor.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">It was as if the wind blowing down from the Alpine valleys had summoned Willi, since he lived in the rustic village of St. Anton in Montafon. Dr. Werner kept silent, driving without showing any interest in Willi. It did not seem so much disinterest as a deliberate attitude of not interfering in his wife&rsquo;s affairs, out of respect. For Westerners steeped in individualism, that might have been the natural way. Yet Writer Jeong and his wife could not help but listen intently to the story of Willi, whom they longed to meet even by kidnapping if necessary.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">&ldquo;Willi is like the reincarnation of Mozart. Once, a nobleman even asked him to complete one of Mozart&rsquo;s unfinished manuscript.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">The musical achievements of composer Willi, as recounted by Chairman Kwon, were dazzling. Willi was undoubtedly one of the world&rsquo;s foremost composers. His works included the orchestral piece Vitality, the opera The War of the Frogs and Mice, the Reminiscence of Tarkovsky: Spaces (R&auml;ume), the opera Brother of Sleep (Schlafes Bruder) based on Robert Schneider&rsquo;s novel and written for Austria&rsquo;s millennium celebration, Encounter (Begegnung) for the Vienna Philharmonic&rsquo;s 150th anniversary, Rondino for Orchestra, the trumpet concertos Irene, Considerable Time, and the symphony Affection (æƒ… Dsong), conceived with the Austrian noble Francesca in mind. His list of honors was equally distinguished: he received the Austrian government&rsquo;s &ldquo;Young Composer&rsquo;s Prize,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Opera Composition Prize,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Decoration of Honor in Gold for Science and Art.&rdquo; He also served as composer-in-residence for the Camerata Academica Salzburg, the Salzburg Festival, the Vienna Musikverein, and the Vienna Konzerthaus Society, patrons of the Vienna Philharmonic. Moreover, Willi&rsquo;s works were performed at Carnegie Hall in New York, the Royal Albert Hall in London, Vienna&rsquo;s Musikverein and Konzerthaus, by ensembles such as the Berlin Philharmonic, Vienna Philharmonic, Cleveland Orchestra, and New Japan Philharmonic, with premieres conducted by Claudio Abbado, Seiji Ozawa, and Christoph von Dohn&aacute;nyi.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">&ldquo;Willi&rsquo;s works are acclaimed all across Europe, and many orchestras are desperate to commission new pieces from him.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">But what intrigued Writer Jeong more than Willi&rsquo;s dazzling musical achievements was the inner world and spirit from which they sprang. As someone largely unfamiliar with classical music, Jeong was more drawn to Willi&rsquo;s mental world, his artistic spirit. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">&ldquo;Where does Mr. Willi find inspiration when composing?&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">&ldquo;Willi visited Korea with me once, in 2004. In Tokyo, the New Japan Philharmonic premiered his trumpet concerto Irene, and on the return trip we stopped in Korea. On September 22, he gave a special lecture at the Korea National University of Arts. I served as his interpreter, so whenever students or journalists asked questions, I translated for him, which is why I can still remember most of his answers. Willi said that he draws his inspiration for composition from absolute silence.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">&ldquo;Absolute silence?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">Jeong&rsquo;s interest was immediately piqued. Back in his student days, while practicing writing fiction, he had once entered into samadhi, sitting at his desk all day without leaving even once. He hadn&rsquo;t noticed day and night passing, nor heard the noises of the outside world. Later, when he asked his teacher Beopjeong Seunim about it, he learned that it was a state of meditative concentration and that very state was absolute silence, absolute stillness itself.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">&ldquo;When a journalist asked, Willi answered like this: The most important thing in my life and in my composition is absolute silence. When I spend days, months, even years walking through the forests of the Alps in search of that silence and stillness, there comes a moment when music begins to sound from deep within me. In that moment, rational judgment and analysis disappear, and an infinite universe beyond the self opens up. Inspiration arises of its own accord. That is when I compose.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">Jeong now became intensely curious about Willi. Willi had once told Chairman Kwon that he would kidnap Jeong if necessary to meet him, but now the roles were reversed. Jeong himself felt like pleading with Chairman Kwon to arrange a meeting with Willi. Willi seemed at once like a medieval Western mystic and a reclusive Eastern Seon [note: Seon is the Korean pronounciation of what is known more widely in the West as Zen] master. Clearly, he was a composer whose temperament aligned less with Western rationalism and distinctions, and more with Eastern intuition and insight.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">&ldquo;And to another question from a music magazine journalist, he answered this way: I wait for months to hear the inner sound and then I encounter silence. I discover the stillness within the soul. At first the music is like a tiny dot, which gradually grows larger. The dot becomes a great sphere and unites with the universe. That sphere reveals itself in every kind of color. Those colors turn into sound. Music becomes not a beginning or an end, but the whole. Thus music is not something created. It is the power of music that leads the composer.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">As a writer specializing in Buddhism, Jeong could not help but be drawn into the essence of Willi&rsquo;s music. Though Willi himself did not know Buddhism well, what he said was almost Buddhist in essence. The fact that Chairman Kwon had served as Willi&rsquo;s interpreter was also of great help to Jeong in understanding him.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">&ldquo;I understand now why Willi&rsquo;s way of thinking is described as Eastern and Buddhist. He even strikes me as a Seon master.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">&ldquo;In fact, Willi eats only one meal a day and is a vegetarian. The only exception is Korean food, which he finds too delicious to resist. He strongly dislikes killing. Above all, like an Eastern Seon master, he says, &lsquo;Human beings and the universe are one.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s something Westerners cannot easily understand.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">&ldquo;Chairman Kwon, you mentioned that in September 2004 you visited Haein-sa with Willi. Was there a particular reason for going to Haein-sa?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">&ldquo;Mountain temples are quiet, you know. I thought Willi would like it. For me, it was my second visit. When Seongcheol Seunim passed away at Haein-sa, I had visited Bongam-sa, and there I happened to meet a monk who led me on to Haein-sa. In any case, Willi said that the Korean autumn was as clear as the weather in Montafon, and he enjoyed it as if he were at home in Montafon.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">&ldquo;I imagine Willi must have felt the autumn tranquility of the mountain temple.&rdquo;</span></p>

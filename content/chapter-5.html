  <p>Dr. Werner, who was driving, was the tallest of the group. At about 180 centimeters, he was a head taller than the others, who were around 160 centimeters. Chairman Kwon sat in the front passenger seat, while Writer Jeong and his wife, Mrs. Park, sat in the back. Since Dr. Werner had a long torso, the crown of his head nearly touched the roof of the car.</p>

  <p>As the car left the outskirts of Vienna and drove toward the city of Krems, the Danube River appeared. The river was not especially wide, but its waters were abundant and seemed deep. The Danube’s expression differed from afar and up close. From a distance it looked pastoral and peaceful, but through the car window as it sped along the bank, the water licked at the grasses and flowed eastward with force. Further west, toward Innsbruck, the upper valley waters grew shallower and sparkled a jade hue. Staring at the distant mountains, Chairman Kwon let the breeze from the half-open window wash over him and began to talk about Mr. Willi.</p>

  <p>“Writer Jeong, Innsbruck is not far now. Mr. Willi was born in the state of Vorarlberg, in the village of St. Anton in the Montafon Valley. His father was a carpenter who could also play the piano and violin. Willi’s grandfather was a carpenter as well. By making furniture such as wardrobes, his father supported the family, but to Willi, he also served as a music tutor.”</p>

  <p>It was as if the wind blowing down from the Alpine valleys had summoned Willi, since he lived in the rustic village of St. Anton in Montafon. Dr. Werner kept silent, driving without showing any interest in Willi. It did not seem so much disinterest as a deliberate attitude of not interfering in his wife’s affairs, out of respect. For Westerners steeped in individualism, that might have been the natural way. Yet Writer Jeong and his wife could not help but listen intently to the story of Willi, whom they longed to meet even by kidnapping if necessary.</p>

  <p>“Willi is like the reincarnation of Mozart. Once, a nobleman even asked him to complete one of Mozart’s unfinished manuscripts.”</p>

  <p>The musical achievements of composer Willi, as recounted by Chairman Kwon, were dazzling. Willi was undoubtedly one of the world’s foremost composers. His works included the orchestral piece <i>Vitality</i>, the opera <i>The War of the Frogs and Mice</i>, the <i>Reminiscence of Tarkovsky: Spaces</i> (<i>Räume</i>), the opera <i>Brother of Sleep</i> (<i>Schlafes Bruder</i>) based on Robert Schneider’s novel and written for Austria’s millennium celebration, <i>Encounter</i> (<i>Begegnung</i>) for the Vienna Philharmonic’s 150th anniversary, <i>Rondino for Orchestra</i>, the trumpet concertos <i>Irene</i> and <i>Considerable Time</i>, and the symphony <i>Affection</i> (情 <i>Dsong</i>), conceived with the Austrian noble Francesca in mind. His list of honors was equally distinguished: he received the Austrian government’s “Young Composer’s Prize,” the “Opera Composition Prize,” and the “Decoration of Honor in Gold for Science and Art.” He also served as composer-in-residence for the Camerata Academica Salzburg, the Salzburg Festival, the Vienna Musikverein, and the Vienna Konzerthaus Society, patrons of the Vienna Philharmonic. Moreover, Willi’s works were performed at Carnegie Hall in New York, the Royal Albert Hall in London, Vienna’s Musikverein and Konzerthaus, by ensembles such as the Berlin Philharmonic, Vienna Philharmonic, Cleveland Orchestra, and New Japan Philharmonic, with premieres conducted by Claudio Abbado, Seiji Ozawa, and Christoph von Dohnányi.</p>

  <p>“Willi’s works are acclaimed all across Europe, and many orchestras are desperate to commission new pieces from him.”</p>

  <p>But what intrigued Writer Jeong more than Willi’s dazzling musical achievements was the inner world and spirit from which they sprang. As someone largely unfamiliar with classical music, Jeong was more drawn to Willi’s mental world, his artistic spirit.</p>

  <p>“Where does Mr. Willi find inspiration when composing?”</p>

  <p>“Willi visited Korea with me once, in 2004. In Tokyo, the New Japan Philharmonic premiered his trumpet concerto <i>Irene</i>, and on the return trip we stopped in Korea. On September 22, he gave a special lecture at the Korea National University of Arts. I served as his interpreter, so whenever students or journalists asked questions, I translated for him, which is why I can still remember most of his answers. Willi said that he draws his inspiration for composition from absolute silence.”</p>

  <p>“Absolute silence?”</p>

  <p>Jeong’s interest was immediately piqued. Back in his student days, while practicing writing fiction, he had once entered into <i>samadhi</i>, sitting at his desk all day without leaving even once. He hadn’t noticed day and night passing, nor heard the noises of the outside world. Later, when he asked his teacher Beopjeong Seunim about it, he learned that it was a state of meditative concentration and that very state was absolute silence, absolute stillness itself.</p>

  <p>“When a journalist asked, Willi answered like this: The most important thing in my life and in my composition is absolute silence. When I spend days, months, even years walking through the forests of the Alps in search of that silence and stillness, there comes a moment when music begins to sound from deep within me. In that moment, rational judgment and analysis disappear, and an infinite universe beyond the self opens up. Inspiration arises of its own accord. That is when I compose.”</p>

  <p>Jeong now became intensely curious about Willi. Willi had once told Chairman Kwon that he would kidnap Jeong if necessary to meet him, but now the roles were reversed. Jeong himself felt like pleading with Chairman Kwon to arrange a meeting with Willi. Willi seemed at once like a medieval Western mystic and a reclusive Eastern Seon master. Clearly, he was a composer whose temperament aligned less with Western rationalism and distinctions, and more with Eastern intuition and insight.</p>

  <p>“And to another question from a music magazine journalist, he answered this way: I wait for months to hear the inner sound and then I encounter silence. I discover the stillness within the soul. At first the music is like a tiny dot, which gradually grows larger. The dot becomes a great sphere and unites with the universe. That sphere reveals itself in every kind of color. Those colors turn into sound. Music becomes not a beginning or an end, but the whole. Thus music is not something created. It is the power of music that leads the composer.”</p>

  <p>As a writer specializing in Buddhism, Jeong could not help but be drawn into the essence of Willi’s music. Though Willi himself did not know Buddhism well, what he said was almost Buddhist in essence. The fact that Chairman Kwon had served as Willi’s interpreter was also of great help to Jeong in understanding him.</p>

  <p>“I understand now why Willi’s way of thinking is described as Eastern and Buddhist. He even strikes me as a Seon master.”</p>

  <p>“In fact, Willi eats only one meal a day and is a vegetarian. The only exception is Korean food, which he finds too delicious to resist. He strongly dislikes killing. Above all, like an Eastern Seon master, he says, ‘Human beings and the universe are one.’ That’s something Westerners cannot easily understand.”</p>

  <p>“Chairman Kwon, you mentioned that in September 2004 you visited Haeinsa with Willi. Was there a particular reason for going to Haeinsa?”</p>

  <p>“Mountain temples are quiet, you know. I thought Willi would like it. For me, it was my second visit. When Seongcheol Seunim passed away at Haeinsa, I had visited Bongamsa, and there I happened to meet a monk who led me on to Haeinsa. In any case, Willi said that the Korean autumn was as clear as the weather in Montafon, and he enjoyed it as if he were at home in Montafon.”</p>

  <p>“I imagine Willi must have felt the autumn tranquility of the mountain temple.”</p>

  <p>“While the rest of us were looking around, Willi remained completely still in the main hall, the Daejeokgwangjeon (Hall of Great Silence and Light), gazing only at the murals.”</p>

  <p>“If it was the murals on the Daejeokgwangjeon, they must have been the <i>Palsangdo</i> (Eight Scenes of the Buddha’s Life).”</p>

  <p>“Chairman Kwon, when Willi looked at the colors of the murals, do you think he might have heard their content as sound?”</p>

  <p>“I don’t know. If you ever meet Willi, be sure to ask him yourself.”</p>

  <p><i>Palsangdo</i> refers to paintings that divide the Buddha’s life into eight stages. Jeong had once published an essay collection titled <i>The Eight Great Episodes in the Buddha’s Life</i>, based on the stories depicted in the <i>Palsangdo</i>. In it, he rendered the Buddha’s life in stages such as: “Where shall we meet again and in what form?”, “What were you before you were born?”, “Even the blooming and withering of the lotus is suffering,” “Receiving the morning sunlight as an offering on the Tilaurakot forest path,” “I cannot stop in the face of your teaching,” “Ah, Siddhartha’s life has already come to its end,” “When he sat cross-legged beneath the bodhi tree, faith surged forth,” “Hearing the truth, one will awaken to it,” “O, Buddha, who dwelt with the suffering and the foolish,” “Open your eyes, and you will see the light,” and “Rely on yourself as a lamp, rely on the Dharma as a lamp.”</p>

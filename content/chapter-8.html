<p>5 a.m.</p>

<p>Moonlight streamed through the guesthouse window, brightening the room. It shimmered across the bed, the white cover dazzling to the eyes. Rising from bed, Author Jeong went straight to the window. Too exhausted the night before, he had fallen asleep without drawing the curtains. He thought of closing them for Mrs. Pak but let it be; dawn would break in half an hour. Unlike Author Jeong, who woke easily at dawn, Mrs. Pak still lay with her face buried in the large pillow.</p>

<p>The moon hung in the sky to the left of the window. Like a yellow mango, it looked ready to roll down from the peaks rising over 2,000 meters. In the pitch-dark Montafon Valley, the moon alone shone with lofty dignity, as though it were master of all.</p>

<p>Author Jeong suddenly thought: if the Montafon Valley had a true master, might it not be Mr. Willi? For just as moonlight reached into every corner, Willi’s music, born of Montafon’s inspiration, was performed in Europe, America, and Asia. At this moment, Jeong might have been the only one looking at the Montafon moon. If so, that moon belonged to the one who now saw and felt it. What meaning had it for those not facing it? The message carried in moonlight was for whomever received it, like Jeong himself. Mrs. Pak spoke, as if dazzled.</p>

<p>“Honey, what time is it, you’re up already?”</p>

<p>“It’s like a gift to see the moon from Montafon. You should take a look too.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Park came to the window wearing a long robe.</p>

<p>“Maybe because the mountains are so high, the moon seems small, doesn’t it? It’s wondrous looking at the moon, but I’m going back to sleep.”</p>

<p>“Honey, that moon makes me think of Mr. Willi.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Willi?”</p>

<p>“A moment ago, I thought Mr. Willi was like a moon lighting up Montafon.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Pak climbed back into bed, saying she needed more sleep, pulling the blanket up to her shoulders. By then the moon had already sunk beyond the high ridges and instead, dawn was breaking over them. Lights of villages in the Montafon valley, on dark slopes and in the basin, flared back to life after a night of darkness. It was like sparks on a great lump of charcoal reigniting and spreading one by one. Yet those earthly lights soon faded with the advancing daylight, swallowed by the red of dawn. The crimson glow lingered in Montafon’s vast sky and mountain flanks.</p>

<p>Author Jeong pondered what to ask Mr. Willi first when they met. What he most wanted to know was by what thread of fate Willi had become a composer, and what that “absolute silence” was where his music began. With just these two questions he felt he could understand the man to some degree. The first belonged to Willi’s destiny, the second could reveal his thoughts and inner world as a composer. As at a temple, one must pass through the Iljumun with its two pillars to reach the Dharma Hall, Author Jeong thought these two questions were Willi’s Iljumun.</p>

<p>After breakfast at the guesthouse, the Jeong couple set off for Mr. Willi’s house a little before the appointed hour. They had agreed yesterday to meet at 9. Mrs. Pak grumbled.</p>

<p>“Don’t show your Korean habits here.”</p>

<p>She was referring to Author Jeong who always hurried to be ahead of time. It was also the “<em>ppalli-ppalli</em>” (hurry, hurry) trait common to the majority of Koreans. Many of his friends, too, were nicknamed “Ten-Minutes-Early,” because they arrived ten minutes before the appointed hour. Some even came thirty minutes early, forcing others to rush into their clothes, but Jeong put more faith in these kinds of people.</p>

<p>Chairman Kwon showed her Korean ways as well, standing in front of Mr. Willi’s house about thirty minutes early. She said:</p>

<p>“Was your lodging comfortable?”</p>

<p>“Yes, not at all uncomfortable. The bread and coffee Mrs. Willi served for breakfast were very good too.”</p>

<p>“She is pure-hearted, as you’d expect from someone who has lived her whole life in Montafon. In Austria, Montafon is like the countryside even of the countryside.”</p>

<p>Chairman Kwon also addressed Mrs. Park.</p>

<p>“While Mr. Jeong is speaking with Mr. Willi, my husband says he will show you around Montafon.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. Won’t Dr. Werner feel troubled?”</p>

<p>“It was my husband who suggested it first, so it’s fine.”</p>

<p>At nine o’clock, Mr. Willi came down the stairs to greet Author Jeong. Chairman Kwon remained behind to interpret, and Mrs. Pak departed in Dr. Werner’s car. Author Jeong and Mr. Willi went up to the living room on the second floor. A small piano stood in the hallway leading to it, and on the opposite wall hung a painting of an orchid. Their conversation turned to the painting, titled “Orchid Fragrance Travels Ten Thousand Miles,” the idea that an orchid’s scent carries a great distance. Judging by its simple, unadorned frame, it had clearly been brought from Korea. In the living room, a large monitor and speakers were set up beneath the window. In front of the L-shaped sofa was a round table, with a transparent glass pitcher at its center holding slices of yellow lemon afloat in water. Everyone drank a cup of the lemon tea to refresh themselves. Soon, Chairman Kwon was skillfully interpreting Mr. Willi’s words.</p>

<p>“I am so happy and grateful that you made the difficult journey here. One day, I heard about you through Sonja (Chairman Kwon’s Austrian name). From that moment, I was certain you would come to Montafon.”</p>

<p>“I felt the same. Though it might take twists and turns, I knew that one day I would meet you, Mr. Willi. And if the chance came, I hoped for a long talk. Today, it seems that hope is coming true.”</p>

<p>“I believe there is a visible world and an invisible one. To people who think and live only in the visible world, such talk may sound strange. But for those who accept the invisible world, our conversation will be very interesting. I think music stands at the boundary between the two, for music shows what is invisible.”</p>

<p>“You said that you were sure I would come to Montafon, Teacher Willi. Then our meeting is not coincidence but a deep connection (<em>inyeon</em>), a destined encounter.”</p>

<p>“Some people do not believe me when I speak of the unseen world. Some intellectuals even consider me strange. I cannot keep long company with such intellectuals, because our mutual trust can’t but be broken.”</p>

<p>“In Korea we say, ‘The arrow of fate strikes the mark even in the darkest night.’ It means our deep connections (<em>inyeon</em>) are inevitable. Those who live only in the visible world think them coincidence. In that sense I understood your words, Teacher Willi.”</p>

<p>As the conversation grew deeper, half-clear and half-obscure, Chairman Kwon sometimes looked troubled while interpreting.</p>

<p>“Since you’ve come all this way from Korea, ask me anything. I’ll answer honestly.”</p>

<p>“Today I will ask only two questions. One is this: in high school I read Camus and Sartre and was drawn into existentialism, that was the cause of my becoming a writer. When and through what event did your musical life begin as destiny, Teacher Willi?”</p>

<p>Mr. Willi closed his eyes as though the memory was painful. Jeong felt almost apologetic, wondering if his question was excessive. At length, Mr. Willi opened his eyes, breaking the silence. His lips and jaw, delicate almost like a woman’s, moved in synchronicity. His large eyes seemed moist with tears.</p>

<p>“From age fifteen I suffered an incurable illness, spending two months at a time between a hospital in Innsbruck and my home in Montafon. By seventeen I was waiting for death in the ward. One by one the patients in my six-bed room went out and never came back.”</p>

<p>It was then that Willi rose from his sickbed and began walking the banks of the Inn River, far from the hospital, in despair. For half the day he walked, not knowing whether to go on living or at any moment leap into the water. At last, he came to a place where it was hard to go on and too far to turn back. Then vast black clouds covered the sky.</p>

  <strong>Translator’s Notes</strong>
  <p>The word <em>inyeon</em> (인연) comes up in this passage. It’s often rendered as “fate” or “destiny,” but in Korean it carries the nuance of connections formed by many causes and conditions. It suggests that meetings are not mere accidents but the result of threads pulling people together. When Author Jeong uses it, he means his meeting with Willi is karmically connected.</p>

  <p>I’ve also chosen to render Jeong’s address as “Teacher Willi.” In Korean, <em>seonsaeng</em> (선생) literally means “teacher,” but it’s also a respectful honorific for artists, professionals, and learned figures. Jeong’s form, <em>Willi Seonsaeng ggyeseo</em>, shows warmth and esteem. “Teacher Willi” conveys that respect more clearly in English than “Mr. Willi” would.</p>
